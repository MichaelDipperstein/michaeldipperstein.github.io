        <h1>Run Length Encoding (RLE) Discussion and Implementation</h1>
        <h3>by Michael Dipperstein</h3>
    </div>

    <hr style="width:100%;">

    <p>The day after I posted my source and description for
    <a href="./arithmetic.html">arithmetic</a> coding, I became unable
    to resist the temptation to bang out something on RLE.  I had a few hours of
    &quot;free time&quot; and what better way to fill them than to publish an
    Run Length Encoding (RLE) implementation?  And so my version 0.1 library was
    born.</p>

    <p>Almost two years after that, I found myself discussing various RLE
    techniques, and the discussion touched on the PackBits technique.  Thus the
    temption to bang out more on RLE arose.  The result of that effort brings
    you rle-0.2, which provides support for traditional and PackBits styles of
    encoding and decoding.</p>

    <p>As with my other compression implementations, my intent is to publish an
    easy to follow ANSI C implementation of a run length encoding (RLE)
    algorithm.  Anyone familiar with ANSI C and RLE should be able to follow and
    learn from my implementation.  I'm sure that there's room for improvement of
    compression ratios, speed, and memory usage, but this project is about
    learning and sharing, not perfection.</p>

    <p>Click here for a link to my <a href="#download">RLE source</a>.  The rest
    of this page discusses RLE and my implementation.</p>

    <hr style="width:100%;">

    <a name="overview"></a>
    <h2>Algorithm Overview</h2>
    <p>Run length encoding stands out from other methods of compression.  It
    does not try to reduce the average symbol size like
    <a href="./huffman.html">Huffman</a> coding or
    <a href="./arithmetic.html">arithmetic</a> coding, and it doesn't
    replace strings with dictionary references like
    <a href="./lzss.html">Lemple-Ziv</a> and <a href="./lzw.html">
    Lemple-Ziv-Welch</a> style coding.  RLE replaces a string of repeated
    symbols with a single symbol and a count (<em>run length</em>) indicating
    the number of times the symbol is repeated.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    The string:<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 2pc;">
        &quot;aaaabbcdeeeeefghhhij&quot;
    </span><br>
    may be replaced with<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 2pc;">
        &quot;a<strong>4</strong>b<strong>2</strong>c<strong>1</strong>d<strong>1</strong>e<strong>5</strong>f<strong>1</strong>g<strong>1</strong>h<strong>3</strong>i<strong>1</strong>j<strong>1</strong>&quot;
    </span></p>

    <p>The numbers are in <strong>bold</strong> to indicate that they are
    values, not symbols.</p>

    <p>If you count the before and after string size, you'll notice that RLE
    didn't make this string any smaller.  Part of the reason is because it now
    takes a symbol and a value to represent what used to take just single a
    single symbol.</p>

    <p>One of the ways of preventing single symbols from expanding is to only
    apply coding to runs of more than one and use the run length to indicate the
    number of additional copies of the encoded symbol that are required.
    Ideally that would give us a string like this:<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 2pc;">
        &quot;a<strong>3</strong>b<strong>1</strong>cde<strong>4</strong>fgh<strong>2</strong>ij&quot;
    </span></p>

    <p>Now the string is shorter, but we have another problem.  How do we know
    whether a symbol is being followed by another symbol or a run length?  We
    could borrow a page out of <a href="./lzss.html">LZSS</a> and include
    an encoded/not encoded flag with each symbol.  An other option is to follow
    each encoded symbol with a designated escape code that will indicate a run
    length follows.</p>

    <p>The escape code solution is pretty easy to handle, except that you need
    to be able to make sure that the escape code doesn't occur in your uncoded
    input, or you need to be able to indicate if you're just handling a symbol
    that is the same as an escape code.</p>

    <p>Someone much more creative than I am at this moment came up with a neat
    idea that solves this problem.  The escape code does not need to be a fixed
    value, instead an escape code will be inferred whenever a symbol repeats
    itself.  The value that follows the repeated symbol will indicate the number
    of additional symbols that follow.  Using this scheme, the example string
    is encoded like this:<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 2pc;">
        &quot;aa<strong>2</strong>bb<strong>0</strong>cdee<strong>3</strong>fghh<strong>1</strong>ij&quot;
    </span></p>

    <p>For lack of a better name, I'll refer to this technique as traditional
    RLE.  The downside to traditional RLE is that one more symbol is required
    for each run, and runs of length 2 take more space encoded than not encoded
    (two symbols and a count of 0).  However, based on a few brief tests on
    files containing C source, the double symbol escape sequence produced better
    results than following all symbols with a run length.</p>

    <p>One technique for reducing the cost of two symbol runs is to encode two
    types of blocks: blocks that are copied verbatim, and runs.  Runs of two
    symbols may be placed in the blocks copied verbatim.  However, this
    technique incurs a penalty in order to be able to indicate that a block
    should be copied verbatim.</p>

    <p>This method was popularized by the PackBits algorithm.  The PackBits
    algorithm will precede a block of data with a one byte header <em>n</em>,
    where <em>n</em> is interpreted as follows:</p>

    <table summary="PackBits block header" border="1">
    <tr>
        <th><em>n</em></th>
        <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0 to 127</td>
        <td>Copy the next <em>n</em> + 1 symbols verbatim</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-127 to -1</td>
        <td>Repeat the next symbol 1 - <em>n</em> times</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-128</td>
        <td>Do nothing</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Hopefully you've been paying attention and noticed the following areas
    of improvements in the PackBits algorithm:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The -128 header could be used for a run of 129 symbols, but it's not.
        <li>It takes two bytes to indicate a run of two, so nothing is saved.
    </ol>

    <p>The library I provide implements a variant of the PackBits algorithm
    where the one byte header is interpreted as follows:</p>

    <table summary="variant PackBits block header" border="1">
    <tr>
        <th><em>n</em></th>
        <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0 to 127</td>
        <td>Copy the next <em>n</em> + 1 symbols verbatim</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-128 to -1</td>
        <td>Repeat the next symbol 2 - <em>n</em> times</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This variant algorithm allows runs to be two symbols longer, but cannot
    encode two byte runs.  Using this scheme, the example string is encoded like
    this:<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 2pc;">
        &quot;<strong>-2</strong>a<strong>3</strong>bbcd<strong>-3</strong>e<strong>1</strong>fg<strong>-1</strong>h<strong>1</strong>ij&quot;
    </span></p>

    <a name="encoding"></a>
    <h3>Encoding Strings</h3>
    <h4>Traditional RLE</h4>

    <p>Encoding using traditional RLE is fairly simple:</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Set the previous symbol equal to an unmatchable
    value.<br>

    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Read the next symbol from the input stream.<br>

    <strong>Step 3.</strong> If the symbol is an EOF exit.<br>

    <strong>Step 4.</strong> Write out the current symbol.<br>

    <strong>Step 5.</strong> If the symbol is an does not match the previous
    symbol, set the previous symbol to the current symbol, and go to step 2.<br>

    <strong>Step 6.</strong> Read and count additional symbols until a
    non-matching symbol is found.  This is the run length.<br>

    <strong>Step 7.</strong> Write out the run length.<br>

    <strong>Step 8.</strong> Write out the non-matching symbol.<br>

    <strong>Step 9.</strong> Set the previous symbol to the non-matching symbol,
    and go to step 2.</p>

    <p>When actually implementing traditional RLE, a little attention to detail
    is required in <strong>Step 6</strong>.  The run length is stored in a
    finite number of bits (I used an <code>unsigned char</code>). Runs longer
    than the amount that can be counted need to be broken up into to smaller
    runs.  When the maximum count is reached, just write the count value and
    start the process of looking for a run all over again.  You also need to
    handle the case where a run is ended by an <strong>EOF</strong>.  When a run
    is ended by an <strong>EOF</strong>, write out the run length and exit.</p>

    <p>That's all there is to it.</p>

    <h4>PackBits Variant</h4>

    <p>Encoding using the PackBits variant is slightly more complicate than
    traditional RLE.  The block header cannot be written until the type of block
    and it's length have been determined.  Until then data must be held in a
    buffer of the maximum length that can be copied verbatim.  The following
    steps describe PackBits style encoding:</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Step 1.</strong> Read symbols from
    the input stream into the buffer until one of the following occurs:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 0%; padding-left: 4pc;">
        <li>The buffer is full (go to step 2)
        <li>An <strong>EOF</strong> is reached (go to step 3)
        <li>The last three symbols are identical (go to step 4)
    </ol>

    <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Step 2.</strong> If
    the buffer is full:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 0%; padding-left: 4pc;">
        <li>write the buffer size - 1
        <li>write contents of the buffer
        <li>go to step 1
    </ol>

    <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Step 3.</strong> If
    the symbol is an <strong>EOF</strong>:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 0%; padding-left: 4pc;">
        <li>write the buffer size - 1
        <li>write contents of the buffer
        <li>exit
    </ol>

    <p style="margin-top: 0px;"><strong>Step 4.</strong> If the last three
    symbols match, a run has been found.  Determine the number of symbols in the
    buffer prior to the start of the run (<em>n</em>).<br>

    <strong>Step 5.</strong> Write <em>n</em> - 1 followed by the contents of
    the buffer up to the start of the run.<br>

    <strong>Step 6.</strong> Set the run length to 3.<br>

    <strong>Step 7.</strong> Read additional symbols until a non-matching symbol
    is found.  Increment the run length for each matching symbol.<br>

    <strong>Step 8.</strong> Write out 2 - the run length the run length
    followed by the run symbol.<br>

    <strong>Step 9.</strong> Write the non-matching symbol to the buffer and go
    to step 1.</p>

    <p>That's pretty much all there is.  You need to stop counting your run
    length in <strong>Step 6</strong> if it reaches the maximum length you can
    account for in your header.  My actual implementation is also a little less
    greedy.  When I reach the maximum number of symbols that can be copied
    verbatim, I read an extra symbol or two in case the symbols at the end of a
    buffer are actually the start of a run.</p>

    <a name="decoding"></a>
    <h3>Decoding Strings</h3>
    <h4>Traditional RLE</h4>

    <p>Decoding traditionally encoded strings is even easier than encoding.  Not
    only are there less steps, but there are no caveats.  To decode a
    traditionally encoded stream:</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Set the previous symbol equal to an unmatchable
    value.<br>

    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Read the next symbol from the input stream.<br>

    <strong>Step 3.</strong> If the symbol is an <strong>EOF</strong> exit.<br>

    <strong>Step 4.</strong> Write out the current symbol.<br>

    <strong>Step 5.</strong> If the symbol is an does not match the previous
    symbol, set the previous symbol to the current symbol, and go to step 2.<br>

    <strong>Step 6.</strong> Read the run length.<br>

    <strong>Step 7.</strong> Write out a run of the current symbol as long as
    indicated by the run length.<br>

    <strong>Step 8.</strong> Go to step 1.</p>

    <h4>PackBits Variant</h4>

    <p>If that wasn't easy enough, it is even easier to decode strings encoded
    by the variant PackBits algorithm.  To decode a variant PackBits encoded
    stream:</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Read the block header (<em>n</em>).<br>

    <strong>Step 2.</strong> If the header is an <strong>EOF</strong> exit.<br>

    <strong>Step 3.</strong> If <em>n</em> is non-negative, copy the next
    <em>n</em> + 1 symbols to the output stream and go to step 1.<br>

    <strong>Step 4.</strong> If <em>n</em> is negative, write 2 - <em>n</em>
    copies of the next symbol to the output stream and go to step 1.</p>
