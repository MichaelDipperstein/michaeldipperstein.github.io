    <h2>TCP, UDP, and a Less Trivial Echo Server</h2>
    <h3>by Michael Dipperstein</h3>

<hr style="width:100%;">

<h2>About The Software</h2>
<p>Sometime during my senior year in college (1989-90 (I know I'm old)) I
needed to write a client and server for an AT&amp;T 3B20 running BSD 4.3.
The World Wide Web wasn't yet world-wide, so my only guide was my personal
multi-volume hard copy of the man pages.</p>

<p>This is not that code.  That code survived on a 3.5&quot; floppy disk that
followed me around for a few years, until I needed it, revised it, and
copied that code to a hard drive.  That code is also not this code.</p>

<p>This code is the result of several iterations of periodically having to
remember how to do something or other with sockets and updating my samples
to use the latest techniques.  Well, not quite.  Since trying to remember
where I put the code was taking up so much time, decided to formalize it and
put it in a location that's <a href="#download">easy to find</a>.  That code
is code that I will describe here.</p>

<p>This isn't 1990 and there are tons of socket examples on the Wold Wide
Web and there are even more copies of all of the man pages there.  Before
describing my code, I'll provide brief descriptions of TCP and UDP as well as
clients and servers here.  However, if that's not enough for you, just take
advantage of your favorite search engine.</p>

<hr style="width:100%;">

<h2>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</h2>

<p>TCP is a connection oriented, reliable, byte stream protocol.  So what does
that mean?</p>

<p>Byte stream protocol means that data is made available as a stream of bytes.
Other byte streams include the Linux file system.  The smallest granularity of
data in a byte stream is one byte, and though bytes may be written and read in
groups, there is no guarantee that the receiver will receive the bytes in the
same grouping that they were sent.</p>

<p>e.g. A sender may send six bytes grouped [0x00, 0x01, 0x02],
[0x03, 0x04, 0x05] and a receiver may receive the six bytes grouped
[0x00, 0x01], [0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05].</p>

<p>In the case of TCP, being reliable means two things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>If the receiver does not acknowledge the receipt of data, the sender
    will resend it.</li>
    <li>Even if the receiver receives data out of order, the data will be
    delivered to the application in order.
        <ul>
          <li>The receiving protocol stack is required to track the sequence
          numbers of the data packets that it received.</li>
          <li>The receiving protocol stack will request a data packet be
          retransmitted after some number of successor data packets have
          arrived</li>
          <li>The receiving protocol stack will refrain from delivering data to
          as application until all data that was transmitted before it has been
          delivered to the application.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Connection oriented means that server must listen for and accept a
connection request from a client before data may be exchanged (more on this
soon).  Once a connection is established a fixed data route is established
between the client and the server; it lasts until either the client or the
server closes its connected socket.</p>

<p>Each end of a TCP connection is associated with an IP address and a port
number.</p>

<h3>TCP Clients and Servers</h3>
<p>TCP clients and TCP servers must connect to each other before exchanging
data.  A TCP client establishes a connection with one server port, a TCP server
may accept connections from multiple clients on the same server port.</p>

<h4>Establishing a Connection as a TCP Client</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Populate a <code>struct addrinfo</code> with information about
    the server that you want to connect to.  At minimum:
    <ul>
        <li><code>ai_family = AF_INET</code></li>
        <li><code>ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM</code></li>
        <li><code>ai_protocol = IPPROTO_TCP</code></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use the <code>getaddrinfo()</code> command to get a linked list of
    potential Internet addresses matching your request.</li>
    <li>Create a socket with the <code>socket()</code> command on one of the
    addresses returned by <code>getaddrinfo()</code>.
        <ul>
            <li>If the <code>socket()</code> returns with failure, go to
            step 3, and try the next address in the linked list.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use the <code>connect()</code> command to connect the socket to the
    server.
        <ul>
            <li>If the <code>connect()</code> returns with success, use
            <code>freeaddrinfo()</code> to free-up the memory that
            <code>getaddrinfo()</code> allocated.</li>
            <li>If the <code>connect()</code> returns with failure, go to
            step 3, and try the next address in the linked list.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The socket from step 3 will be used for all communication.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Exchanging Data</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Data from the server may be received with the <code>read()</code> or
    <code>recv()</code> commands.</li>
    <li>Data may be sent to the server with the <code>write()</code> or
    <code>send()</code> commands.</li>
    <li>Threads, the <code>select()</code> command, or the <code>poll()</code>
    command may be used to perform other tasks while waiting to send or
    receive data.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Closing the Connection</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When done exchanging data, use close <code>close()</code> command
    on the socket to end the connection.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width:60%;">

<h4>Listening for Connections as a TCP Server</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Create a TCP/IP socket with the <code>socket()</code> command.</li>
    <li>Populate a <code>struct sockaddr_in</code> with information about
    the allowable incoming addresses and the port being used.</li>
    <li>Use the <code>bind()</code> command to bind the socket to the
    port specified in the <code>struct sockaddr_in</code> stucture.</li>
    <li>Use the <code>listen()</code> command to cause the socket to listen for
    incoming connections.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Accepting Connections as a TCP Servers</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Use the <code>accept()</code> command on the listening socket to accept
    the incoming connections.
    <ul>
        <li><code>accept()</code> returns the descriptor for the socket that
        to be used for exchanging data.</li>
        <li>Additional calls to <code>accept()</code> may be used to establish
        connections with other clients trying to connect.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Threads, the <code>select()</code> command, or the <code>poll()</code>
    command may be used to perform other tasks while waiting accept other
    connections.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Exchanging Data</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Data from a client may be received with the <code>read()</code> or
    <code>recv()</code> commands.</li>
    <li>Data may be sent to a client with the <code>write()</code> or
    <code>send()</code> command.</li>
    <li>Threads, the <code>select()</code> command, or the <code>poll()</code>
    command may be used to perform other tasks while waiting to send or
    receive data.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Closing the Connection</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When done exchanging data with a client, use the <code>close()</code>
    command on the socket to end the connection.</li>
    <li>When done accepting connections witht new clients, use the
    <code>close()</code> command on the listening socket.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width:100%;">

<h2>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</h2>
<p>UDP is a packet oriented, connectionless protocol.  So what does
that mean?</p>

<p>Data is sent and received in packets called datagrams.  Datagrams are just
groups of bytes.  A receiver will receive data in the same byte grouping that
the sender sent them.</p>

<p>e.g. A sender may send six bytes grouped [0x00, 0x01, 0x02],
[0x03, 0x04, 0x05] and if they are received, the receiver will only receive
the six bytes group as [0x00, 0x01, 0x02], [0x03, 0x04, 0x05].  More on this
later.</p>

<p>Connectionless means that server does not listen for or accept connection
requests from clients, and fixed routes are not established for packets.
Two packets sent from a sender to the same receiver may take different routes
and arrive out of order, and a packet sent from a sender is not guaranteed to be
received by the receiver.</p>

<p>e.g. The above mentioned packets of [0x00, 0x01, 0x02] and
[0x03, 0x04, 0x05] may be received as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>[0x00, 0x01, 0x02] then [0x03, 0x04, 0x05]</li>
    <li>[0x03, 0x04, 0x05] then [0x00, 0x01, 0x02]</li>
    <li>only [0x00, 0x01, 0x02]</li>
    <li>only [0x03, 0x04, 0x05]</li>
    <li>nothing at all</li>
</ul>

<h3>UDP Clients and Servers</h3>
<p>Since UDP is connectionless, there is no need for UDP clients and UDP servers
to connect to each other before exchanging data.  The only thing a UDP client
needs to do is open a socket for UDP communication with the server's address and
port.  The client's socket may only be used to communicate with one server.
A UDP server must bind a datagram socket to a local port for sending and
receiving UDP messages to UDP clients.  The server may use the same socket for
communicating with multiple servers.</p>

<h4>Opening a Socket as a UDP Client</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Populate a <code>struct addrinfo</code> with information about
    the server that you want to exchange datagrams with.  At minimum:
    <ul>
        <li><code>ai_family = AF_INET</code></li>
        <li><code>ai_socktype = SOCK_DGRAM</code></li>
        <li><code>ai_protocol = IPPROTO_UDP</code></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use the <code>getaddrinfo()</code> command to get a linked list of
    potential Internet addresses matching your request.</li>
    <li>Create a socket with the <code>socket()</code> command on one of the
    addresses returned by <code>getaddrinfo()</code>.
        <ul>
            <li>If the <code>socket()</code> returns with failure, go to
            step 3, and try the next address in the linked list.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Copy the server address from the <code>ai_addr</code> field of the
    address that was used to create the socket.</li>
    <li>Use <code>freeaddrinfo()</code> to free-up the memory that
    <code>getaddrinfo()</code> allocated.</li>
    <li>The socket from step 3 and address from step 4 will be used for all
    communication.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Exchanging Data</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Data from the server may be received with the <code>recvfrom()</code>
    command.</li>
    <li>Data may be sent to the server with the <code>sendto()</code>
    command.</li>
    <li>Threads, the <code>select()</code> command, or the <code>poll()</code>
    command may be used to perform other tasks while waiting to send or
    receive data.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Closing the Connection</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When done exchanging data, use close <code>close()</code> command
    on the socket to session.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width:60%;">

<h4>Opening a Socket as a UDP Server</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Create a UDP/IP socket with the <code>socket()</code> command.</li>
    <li>Populate a <code>struct sockaddr_in</code> with information about
    the allowable incoming addresses and port being used.</li>
    <li>Use the <code>bind()</code> command to bind the socket to the
    port specified in the <code>struct sockaddr_in</code> stucture.
        <ul>
            <li>UDP sockets are connectionless, so there is need to
            <code>listen()</code> for or <code>accept()</code> connections.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Exchanging Data</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Data from the server may be received with the <code>recvfrom()</code>
    command.</li>
    <li>Data may be sent to the server with the <code>sendto()</code>
    command.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> <code>sendto()</code> requires a
        <code>struct sockaddr</code> to send the datagram to.  That will likely
        come from an earlier <code>recvfrom()</code>.  Meaning the client must
        be the first to send data.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Threads, the <code>select()</code> command, or the <code>poll()</code>
    command may be used to perform other tasks while waiting to send or
    receive data.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Closing the Connection</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When done exchanging data, use close <code>close()</code> command
    on the socket to session.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width:100%;">

<h2>Echo Examples</h2>
<p>I have implemented slightly fancy echo examples demonstrating how everything
comes together.  The examples are purely educational and should not be used
as-is to implement a real world platform.  In the traditional echo example
a echo server will send data received from a client back to that client.  The
example code that I provide implements a server that will echo data received
from a client to <em>all known clients</em>.</p>

<p>Any client communicating with a server is tracked by the file descriptor for
the socket used to communicate with it.  The TCP server is made aware of a
client disconnects by a receive event on the connected socket.  UDP is
connectionless and there is no mechanism built in to the protocol to alert the
server that the client is closing the socket used to communicate with it.  In my
implementation the UDP client sends a 0 byte packet to the server prior to
closing the socket.  The 0 byte message is something that I made up.  It is
not part of the UDP protocol.</p>

<p>The servers and clients require the ability to multitask.  I chose to
implement multitasking with <code>poll()</code>; it blocks until an event occurs
on any of the file descriptors it has been passed.</p>

<h3>Running the Executables</h3>
<p>All of my examples are console programs that may be executed from a
command line prompt in the directory containing their binary images.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is not possible to mix and match TCP and UDP
client/server pairs.</p>

<h4>echoserver or echoserver_udp</h4>
<p><code>echoserver &lt;port number&gt;<br>
echoserver_udp &lt;port number&gt;</code></p>

<p>The <code>echoserver</code> will not exit until <code>CTRL-c</code>
is pressed.</p>

<h4>echoclient or echoclient_udp</h4>
<p><code>echoclient &lt;server address&gt; &lt;port number&gt;<br>
echoclient_udp &lt;server address&gt; &lt;port number&gt;</code></p>

<p>Hit <code>Enter</code> on a blank line to exit from an
<code>echoclient</code>.<br>
Multiple <code>echoclient</code>s may connect to a single
<code>echoserver</code> instance.  A message sent from any
<code>echoclient</code> will be echoed to all <code>echoclient</code>s.</p>

<h3>Building Executables from Source</h3>
<p>To build these files with GNU make and gcc:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open a terminal</li>
    <li>Change directory to the directory containing the source files</li>
    <li>Enter the command <code>make</code> from the command line</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="download">Actual Software</h2>
<p>I am releasing my Berkeley Socket examples under the
<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">BSD License</a>.
There's no rocket science in the examples.  If you don't like the BSD
License, you could look at my examples and write your own version of code
pretty easily.  The source code repository containing my examples is
available on <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>.  I recommend that
you checkout the latest revision of the master branch, unless you're looking
for something specific.</p>

<table class="repotable">

<hr style="width:100%;">

<h3>Portability</h3>
<p>All the source code that I have provided is written in strict ANSI C.
However, it requires Berkeley Sockets, poll, and signalfd.  So it is only
likely to work on Linux systems; it may be re-written without signalfd for
all POSIX compliant systems, including BSD.</p>
