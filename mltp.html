        <h1>MLTP - A Multi-Layer (M&times;N) Thread Package for SMP
        Linux (Thesis Project)</h1>
        <h3>by Michael Dipperstein</h3>

    <hr style="width:100%;">

    <h3>History</h3>

    <p>The Multi-layer Thread Package was the thesis project that I did for my
    Masters in Computer Science from the
    <a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu">Universtity of California, Santa Barbara</a>
    in September 2000.</p>

    <p>I started thinking about this project back in 1998.  Linux version 2.0
    with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing">
    Symmetric Multiprocessing</a> (SMP) support had been out for a few years,
    but it was far from perfect. For starters, there was a lot of locking
    within the kernel, preventing a decent amount of code from running in
    parallel.  Linux version 2.2 came out the following year and removed a lot
    of the spinlocks in the kernel, but the <a
    href="https://kernelnewbies.org/BigKernelLock">BigKernelLock</a> still
    existed and context switching between processes was still relatively
    expensive.</p>

    <p>I was interested in parallelizing algorithms.  Breaking up algorithms
    into multiple processes allows them to run in parallel.  Each SMP processor
    can execute its own process.  The problem is, if there are more processes
    than processors, you bump into the slow context switching problems whenever
    a processor switches to another process.</p>

    <p>My idea was to avoid context switching by parallelizing the algorithm
    in user-level threads that run on top of kernel level threads.  Then I could
    restrict the kernel-level threads to match the number of processors and
    have as many user-level threads as made sense for the algorithm.  In
    theory MLTP can help to maximize parallel execution by keeping the number of
    context switches that go through the kernel to a minimum.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline;">NOTE:</span>
    MLTP was completed in 2000.  The state-of-art Intel x86 processors had a
    32-bit architecture.  The MLTP source code assumes a 32-bit x86
    architecture and will not compile for any other architectures.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>The multi-level thread package (MLTP) contributes an extensible, open
    source, two-level thread package for SMP Linux on 32-bit Intel x86
    processors.  By layering user-level threads on top of kernel-level threads,
    MLTP is able to provide most of the advantages of both thread user- and
    kernel-level architectures while limiting the disadvantages. MLTP
    provides:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low per-thread overhead.</strong> Each user-level thread
      requires a small amount of space to store context registers and its own
      private stack. No kernel resources are utilized by MLTP user-level
      threads.</li>

      <li><strong>Quick thread context switching.</strong> User-level thread
      context switching under MLTP does not require any kernel intervention,
      there are no kernel traps or process context switches and rescheduling.
      User-level context switching does not require computations to be made in
      order to determine which thread should be executed next, therefore the
      time required for a context switch does not increase as the number of
      threads increases.</li>

      <li><strong>Multi-processor utilization.</strong> By running user-level
      threads on top of kernel-level threads, the user-level threads may run on
      multiple processors and still take advantage of a shared thread
      space.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>MLTP has been created as an open source, extensible, and well commented
    thread package so that it may serve as a platform for further research in
    multi-level thread systems in SMP Linux.  In an attempt to maintain
    clarity and portability, MLTP does not utilize any kernel patches to
    provide a multi-layer threading. It is not the intention of this project to
    be the final authority on the subject of multi-level threads for SMP
    Linux.</p>

    <p>MLTP has been benchmarked using both synthetic and application
    benchmarks, demonstrating a flexible set of primitives and performance
    improvements which may exceed ten percent when compared to kernel-level
    threads alone.</p>
