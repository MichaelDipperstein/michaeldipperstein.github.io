    <h1>MLTP - A Multi-Layer (M&times;N) Thread Package for SMP
    Linux (Thesis Project)</h1>
    <h3>by Michael Dipperstein</h3>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>The Multi-layer Thread Package was the thesis project that I did for my
Masters in Computer Science from the
<a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu">Universtity of California, Santa Barbara</a>
in September 2000.</p>

<p>I started thinking about this project back in 1998.  Linux version 2.0
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing">
Symmetric Multiprocessing</a> (SMP) support had been out for a few years,
but it was far from perfect. For starters, there was a lot of locking
within the kernel, preventing a decent amount of code from running in
parallel.  Linux version 2.2 came out the following year and removed a lot
of the spinlocks in the kernel, but the <a
href="https://kernelnewbies.org/BigKernelLock">BigKernelLock</a> still
existed and context switching between processes was still relatively
expensive.</p>

<p>I was interested in parallelizing algorithms.  Breaking up algorithms
into multiple processes allows them to run in parallel.  Each SMP processor
can execute its own process.  The problem is, if there are more processes
than processors, you bump into the slow context switching problems whenever
a processor switches to another process.</p>

<p>My idea was to avoid context switching by parallelizing the algorithm
in user-level threads that run on top of kernel level threads.  Then I could
restrict the kernel-level threads to match the number of processors and
have as many user-level threads as made sense for the algorithm.  In
theory MLTP can help to maximize parallel execution by keeping the number of
context switches that go through the kernel to a minimum.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline;">NOTE:</span>
MLTP was completed in 2000.  The state-of-art Intel x86 processors had a
32-bit architecture.  The MLTP source code assumes a 32-bit x86
architecture and will not compile for any other architectures.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The multi-level thread package (MLTP) contributes an extensible, open
source, two-level thread package for SMP Linux on 32-bit Intel x86
processors.  By layering user-level threads on top of kernel-level threads,
MLTP is able to provide most of the advantages of both thread user- and
kernel-level architectures while limiting the disadvantages. MLTP
provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Low per-thread overhead.</strong> Each user-level thread
  requires a small amount of space to store context registers and its own
  private stack. No kernel resources are utilized by MLTP user-level
  threads.</li>

  <li><strong>Quick thread context switching.</strong> User-level thread
  context switching under MLTP does not require any kernel intervention,
  there are no kernel traps or process context switches and rescheduling.
  User-level context switching does not require computations to be made in
  order to determine which thread should be executed next, therefore the
  time required for a context switch does not increase as the number of
  threads increases.</li>

  <li><strong>Multi-processor utilization.</strong> By running user-level
  threads on top of kernel-level threads, the user-level threads may run on
  multiple processors and still take advantage of a shared thread
  space.</li>
</ul>

<p>MLTP has been created as an open source, extensible, and well commented
thread package so that it may serve as a platform for further research in
multi-level thread systems in SMP Linux.  In an attempt to maintain
clarity and portability, MLTP does not utilize any kernel patches to
provide a multi-layer threading. It is not the intention of this project to
be the final authority on the subject of multi-level threads for SMP
Linux.</p>

<p>MLTP has been benchmarked using both synthetic and application
benchmarks, demonstrating a flexible set of primitives and performance
improvements which may exceed ten percent when compared to kernel-level
threads alone.</p>
