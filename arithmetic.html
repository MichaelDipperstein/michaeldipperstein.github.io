    <hr style="width:100%;">

    <p>The insanity continues.  After playing with
    <a href="../huffman/index.html">Huffman</a> coding and
    <a href="../lzss/index.html">LZSS</a>, I had to give arithmetic coding a
    try.  It wasn't enough to understand how it worked I had to actually
    implement it.
    </p>

    <p>I've read about what this stuff did to
    <a href="http://www.ross.net/compression/">Ross Williams</a>.
    I can only hope that I'm not going to be subjected to a similar fate.
    </p>

    <p>As with my other compression implementations, my intent is to publish
    an easy to follow ANSI C implementation of the arithmetic coding
    algorithm.  Anyone familiar with ANSI C and the arithmetic coding
    algorithm should be able to follow and learn from my implementation.
    There's a lot of room for improvement of compression ratios, speed, and
    memory usage, but this project is about learning and sharing, not
    perfection.</p>

    <p>Recently (since 2008 or so) I've been using
    <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> when I've needed quick hacks
    to do something on a PC (vs an embedded system).  I eventually wrote a
    <a href="../bitfile/index.html">bitfile library</a> for Python, then I
    realized that I needed a to write some code that actually uses the
    library, so now there's a Python implementation of the arithmetic coding
    algorithm.</p>

    <p>Click <a href="#download">here</a> for information on downloading my
    source code.</p>

    <p>The rest of this page discusses arithmetic coding and the results of
    my efforts so far.</p>

    <hr style="width:100%;">

    <a name="overview"></a>
    <h2>Algorithm Overview</h2>
    <p>Arithmetic coding is similar to <a href="../huffman/index.html">
    Huffman</a> coding; they both achieve their compression by reducing the
    average number of bits required to represent a symbol.</p>

    <p><strong>Given:</strong><br>
    An alphabet with symbols S<sub>0</sub>, S<sub>1</sub>, ...
    S<sub>n</sub>, where each symbol has a probability of occurrence of
    p<sub>0</sub>, p<sub>1</sub>, ... p<sub>n</sub> such that &sum;p<sub>i</sub>
    = 1.<br><br>

    From the fundamental theorem of information theory, it can be shown that
    the optimal coding for S<sub>i</sub> requires
    (p<sub>i</sub>&times;log<sub>2</sub>(p<sub>i</sub>)) bits.</p>

    <p>More often than not, the optimal number of bits is fractional.
    Unlike Huffman coding, arithmetic coding provides the ability to
    represent symbols with fractional bits.</p>

    <p>Since, &sum;p<sub>i</sub> = 1, we can represent each probability,
    p<sub>i</sub>, as a unique non-overlapping range of values between 0 and
    1.  There's no magic in this, we're just creating ranges on a
    probability line.</p>

    <p>For example, suppose we have an alphabet 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'
    with probabilities of occurrence of 30%, 15%, 25%, 10%, and 20%.  We can
    choose the following range assignments to each symbol based on its
    probability:</p>

    <a name="table1"></a>
    <table border="1" summary="Symbol Ranges">
        <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">
            TABLE 1.  Sample Symbol Ranges
        </caption>

            <tr style="font-weight: bold;">
                <td>Symbol</td>

            <tr>
                <td>a</td>
                <td>30%</td>

    </table>

    <p>Where square brackets '[' and ']' mean the adjacent number is
    included and parenthesis '(' and ')' mean the adjacent number is
    excluded.</p>

    <p>Ranges assignments like the ones in this table can then be use for
    <a href="#encoding">encoding</a> and <a href="#decoding">decoding</a>
    strings of symbols in the alphabet.  Algorithms using ranges for coding
    are often referred to as range coders.</p>

    <a name="encoding"></a>
    <h3>Encoding Strings</h3>
    <p>By assigning each symbol its own unique probability range, it's
    possible to encode a single symbol by its range.  Using this approach,
    we could encode a string as a series of probability ranges, but that
    doesn't compress anything.  Instead additional symbols may be encoded by
    restricting the current probability range by the range of a new symbol
    being encoded.  The pseudo code below illustrates how additional symbols
    may be added to an encoded string by restricting the string's range
    bounds.</p>

    <div style="padding-left: 2pc;">
    <code>
    lower&nbsp;bound = 0<br>
    upper&nbsp;bound = 1<br><br>

    while there are still symbols to encode<br>
    </code>
    </div>

        <div style="padding-left: 4pc;">
        <code>
        current&nbsp;range = upper&nbsp;bound - lower&nbsp;bound<br>
        upper&nbsp;bound = lower&nbsp;bound +
            (current&nbsp;range &times;
            upper&nbsp;bound&nbsp;of&nbsp;new&nbsp;symbol)<br>
        lower&nbsp;bound = lower&nbsp;bound +
            (current&nbsp;range &times;
            lower&nbsp;bound&nbsp;of&nbsp;new&nbsp;symbol)<br>
        </code>
        </div>

    <div style="padding-left: 2pc;">
    <code>
    end while
    </code>
    </div>

    <p>Any value between the computed lower and upper probability bounds now
    encodes the input string.</p>

    <a name="example1"></a>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    Encode the string &quot;ace&quot; using the probability ranges from
    <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>.</p>

    <p>
    Start with lower and upper probability bounds of 0 and 1.<br>
    <br>
    Encode 'a'<br>
    current range = 1 - 0 = 1<br>
    upper bound = 0 + (1 &times; 0.3) = 0.3<br>
    lower bound = 0 + (1 &times; 0.0) = 0.0<br>
    <br>
    Encode 'c'<br>
    current range = 0.3 - 0.0 = 0.3<br>
    upper bound = 0.0 + (0.3 &times; 0.70) = 0.210<br>
    lower bound = 0.0 + (0.3 &times; 0.45) = 0.135<br>
    <br>
    Encode 'e'<br>
    current range = 0.210 - 0.135 = 0.075<br>
    upper bound = 0.135 + (0.075 &times; 1.00) = 0.210<br>
    lower bound = 0.135 + (0.075 &times; 0.80) = 0.195<br>
    <br>
    The string &quot;ace&quot; may be encoded by <b>any</b> value within the
    probability range [0.195, 0.210).</p>

    <p>It should become apparent from the example that precision
    requirements increase as additional symbols are encoded.  Strings of
    unlimited length require infinite precision probability range bounds.
    The section on <a href="#implementation">implementation</a> discusses
    how the need for infinite precision is handled.</p>

    <a name="decoding"></a>
    <h3>Decoding Strings</h3>
    <p>The decoding process must start with a an encoded value representing
    a string.  By definition, the encoded value lies within the lower and
    upper probability range bounds of the string it represents.  Since the
    encoding process keeps restricting ranges (without shifting), the
    initial value also falls within the range of the first encoded symbol.
    Successive encoded symbols may be identified by removing the scaling
    applied by the known symbol.  To do this, subtract out the lower
    probability range bound of the known symbol, and multiply by the size of
    the symbols' range.</p>

    <p>Based on the discussion above, decoding a value may be performed
    following the steps in the pseudo code below:</p>

    <div style="padding-left: 2pc;">
    <code>
    encoded&nbsp;value = encoded&nbsp;input<br><br>

    while string is not fully decoded<br>
    </code>
    </div>

        <div style="padding-left: 4pc;">
        <code>
        identify the symbol containing encoded value within its range<br><br>

        //remove effects of symbol from encoded value<br>
        current&nbsp;range =
            upper&nbsp;bound&nbsp;of&nbsp;new&nbsp;symbol -
            lower&nbsp;bound&nbsp;of&nbsp;new&nbsp;symbol<br>
        encoded&nbsp;value =
            (encoded&nbsp;value - lower&nbsp;bound&nbsp;of&nbsp;new&nbsp;symbol)
            &divide; current range<br>
        </code>
        </div>

    <div style="padding-left: 2pc;">
    <code>
    end while
    </code>
    </div>

    <a name="example2"></a>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    Using the probability ranges from <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> decode
    the three character string encoded as 0.20.</p>

    <p>
    Decode first symbol<br>
    0.20 is within [0.00, 0.30)<br>
    0.20 encodes 'a'<br>
    <br>
    Remove effects of 'a' from encode value<br>
    current range = 0.30 - 0.00 = 0.30<br>
    encoded value = (0.20 - 0.0) &divide; 0.30 = 0.67 (<em>rounded</em>)<br>
    <br>
    Decode second symbol<br>
    0.67 is within [0.45, 0.70)<br>
    0.67 encodes 'c'<br>
    <br>
    Remove effects of 'c' from encode value<br>
    current range = 0.70 - 0.45 = 0.35<br>
    encoded value = (0.67 - 0.45) &divide; 0.35 = 0.88<br>
    <br>
    Decode third symbol<br>
    0.88 is within [0.80, 1.00)<br>
    0.88 encodes 'e'<br>
    <br>
    The encoded string is &quot;ace&quot;.<br>
    In case you were sleeping, this is the string that was encoded in the
    encoding <a href="#example1">example</a>.</p>

    <p>There are two issues I've glossed over with this example: knowing
    when to stop, and the required computational precision.  The section on
    <a href="#implementation">implementation</a> addresses both of these
    issues.</p>

    <a name="implementation"></a>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>This section discusses some of the issues of implementing an
    arithmetic encoder/decoder and the approach that I took to handle those
    issues.  As I  have already stated, my implementation is intended to be
    easy to develop and follow, not necessarily optimal.</p>

    <h3>What is a Symbol</h3>
    <p>One of the first questions that needs to be resolved before you start
    is &quot;What is a symbol?&quot;.  For my implementation a symbol is any
    8 bit combination as well as an End Of File (<strong>EOF</strong>) marker.
    This means that there are 257 possible symbols in any encoded stream.</p>

    <a name="infinite"></a>
    <h3>Infinite Precision</h3>
    <p>In my <a href="#overview">algorithm overview</a> I noted that the
    lower and upper probability range bounds as well as the encoded value
    theoretically require infinite precision values on the range [0, 1).
    The method chosen to handle this largely impacts the rest of the
    implementation.  Not wanting to blaze new trials, I chose to use the
    common solution.  Values on the probability range scale will be
    represented as infinite length fixed point values, with the binary point
    before the most significant bit.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    .00000... = 0<br>
    .10000... = 1/2<br>
    .01000... = 1/4<br>
    .11000... = 3/4<br>
    .11111... = 1</p>

    <h4>Wow Infinity.  That's a Lot of Bits.</h4>
    <p>Fortunately for us, we don't need to operate on all the bits at once.
    As additional symbols are encoded, the lower and upper range bounds
    converge.  As the bounds converge, their most significant bits stop
    changing.  By choosing the precision of each symbol's range bounds, we
    can also limit the amount of bits required for each computation.</p>

    <p>As you read through this section, you will learn how it is possible
    to achieve good compression results using 16 bit computations.</p>

    <a name="ranges"></a>
    <h3>Computing Probability Ranges</h3>
    <p>I've implemented both static and adaptive order-0 probability
    <a href="#model">models</a>.  The my static model computes probability
    ranges based on symbols counts obtained by making a pass on the input
    prior to starting the encoding.  Others may use a predetermined set of
    ranges.  My adaptive model assumes a uniform distribution and updates
    itself as new symbols are processed.</p>

    <p>For my static model, the first step to computing probability ranges
    for each symbol is to simply count occurrences of each symbol, as well
    as the total numbers of symbols.</p>

    <p>The next step is to scale all of the symbol counts so that they can
    be used in N bit computations.  To do this symbol counts must be scaled to
    use no more than N - 2 bits.  In the case of 16 bit computations, counts
    must be 14 bits or less.  You'll see why in the next section.</p>

    <p>Use the following steps to scale the counts to be used with N bit
    integer math:<br>

    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Divide the total symbol count by
    2<sup>(N - 2)</sup><br>

    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Using integer division, divide each individual
    symbol count by the ceiling of the result of Step 1.<br>

    <strong>Step 3.</strong> If a non-zero count became zero, make it one.</p>

    <p>Now we have a scaled count for each symbol.  We need to convert the
    scaled counts to range bounds on a probability line.  For an alphabet
    with symbols S<sub>0</sub>, S<sub>1</sub>, ... S<sub>n</sub> and scaled
    counts c<sub>0</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, ... c<sub>n</sub>, we can define
    ranges as follows:</p>

    <a name="table2"></a>
    <table border="1" summary="Scaled Symbol Ranges">
        <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">
            TABLE 2.  Scaled Symbol Ranges
        </caption>
        <tbody>
            <tr style="font-weight: bold;">
                <td>Symbol</td>
                <td>Range</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>S<sub>0</sub></td>
                <td>[0, c<sub>0</sub>)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>S<sub>1</sub></td>
                <td>[upper range of S<sub>0</sub>,
                upper range of S<sub>0</sub> + c<sub>1</sub>)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>S<sub>2</sub></td>
                <td>[upper range of S<sub>1</sub>,
                upper range of S<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">
                <td>.<br>.<br>.</td>
                <td>.<br>.<br>.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>S<sub>n</sub></td>
                <td>[upper range of S<sub>n - 1</sub>,
                upper range of S<sub>n - 1</sub> + c<sub>n</sub>)</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>For my adaptive model we start with scaled symbols, but the N - 2 bit
    restriction still applies.  It's possible to add the effect of a new
    symbol that would make the symbol count too large to be represented by
    N - 2 bits (see <a href="#adaptive">Adaptive Model and Symbol Range
    Updates</a>). When this happens, I just rescale the current model for
    half the symbol count.</p>

    <p>Use the following steps to scale an adaptive model to be used with N bit
    use integer math:<br>

    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Determine the probability range for each symbol in
    the model.<br>

    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Halve each of the ranges from Step 1.<br>

    <strong>Step 3.</strong> The new range for symbol S<sub>i</sub>
    [upper bound of symbol S<sub>i - 1</sub>,
    upper bound of symbol S<sub>i - 1</sub> + range from step 2).<br>

    NOTE: The upper bound of symbol S<sub>-1</sub> = 0</p>

    <h4>Encoding with Scaled Ranges</h4>
    <p>The standard form of arithmetic coding's <a href="#encoding">encoding</a>
    is based on fractional ranges on a probability line between 0 and 1.  We
    just assigned our symbols probability ranges on a probability line
    between 0 and &sum;c<sub>i</sub> (The total symbol count rescaled).  The
    <a href="#encoding">encoding</a> algorithm needs to be adapted for our
    new range scale.</p>

    <p>The following pseudo code modifies the standard form of the encoding
    algorithm for a range scale of [0, &sum;c<sub>i</sub>):</p>

    <div style="padding-left: 2pc;">
    <code>
    lower&nbsp;bound = 0<br>
    upper&nbsp;bound = &sum;c<sub>i</sub><br><br>

    while there are still symbols to encode<br>
    </code>
    </div>

        <div style="padding-left: 4pc;">
        <code>
        current&nbsp;range = upper&nbsp;bound - lower&nbsp;bound + 1<br>
        upper&nbsp;bound = lower&nbsp;bound + ((current&nbsp;range &times;
            upper&nbsp;bound&nbsp;of&nbsp;new&nbsp;symbol)
            &divide; &sum;c<sub>i</sub>) - 1<br>
        lower&nbsp;bound = lower&nbsp;bound + (current&nbsp;range &times;
            lower&nbsp;bound&nbsp;of&nbsp;new&nbsp;symbol) &divide;
            &sum;c<sub>i</sub><br>
        </code>
        </div>
    <div style="padding-left: 2pc;">
    <code>
    end while
    </code>
    </div>

    <p>There are a few important things to know about this algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Notice that 1 is added to the computed current range.  This is because
    the range is [<code>lower&nbsp;bound, upper&nbsp;bound</code>), including
    all values up to <code>upper&nbsp;bound + 1</code>.
    <li>The current range must be able to be stored in a value of N bits ((max
    upper bound - min lower bound + 1) &lt 2<sup>N</sup>).
    <li>Computing the new upper and lower bounds require that the multiplication
    precede the division to avoid loss of precision.
    <li>&sum;c<sub>i</sub> must be less than 2<sup>(N - 2)</sup> when using N
    bits.  This keeps (current range &divide; &sum;c<sub>i</sub>) &ge; 2.  Which
    in turn keeps the upper and lower bounds from crossing.
    </ul>

    <h4>Decoding with Scaled Ranges</h4>
    <p>The standard form of arithmetic coding's <a href="#decoding">decoding</a>
    is also based on fractional ranges on a probability line between 0 and 1.
    Like <a href="#scaledencode">encoding</a>, we have to rescale our
    calculations for the decoding process.</p>

    <p>The following pseudo code modifies the standard form of the decoding
    algorithm for a range scale of [0, &sum;c<sub>i</sub>):</p>

    <div style="padding-left: 2pc;">
    <code>
    encoded&nbsp;value = encoded&nbsp;input<br>
    lower&nbsp;bound = 0<br>
    upper&nbsp;bound = &sum;c<sub>i</sub><br><br>

    while string is not fully decoded<br>
    </code>
    </div>

        <div style="padding-left: 4pc;">
        <code>
        // remove scaling<br>
        current&nbsp;range = upper&nbsp;bound - lower&nbsp;bound + 1<br>
        encoded&nbsp;value = (encoded&nbsp;value - lower&nbsp;bound) +
            1;<br>
        encoded&nbsp;value = (encoded&nbsp;value &times; &sum;c<sub>i</sub>)
            &divide; current&nbsp;range<br>
        </code>
        </div>
    <div style="padding-left: 2pc;">
    <code>
    end while
    </code>
    </div>

    <a name="limiting"></a>
    <h3>Limiting Computations to N Bits</h3>
    <p>We have a way of representing floating point values as an
    <a href="#infinite">infinite</a> stream of bits, we have a way of
    <a href="#ranges">scaling</a> our probability ranges to N - 2 bits,
    and we can encode and decode using the scaled values.  This still
    doesn't get us to a finite number of bits.  There are a few facts that
    we can use to develop a solution that limits computations to N bits:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>The lower bound starts as an infinite stream of bits set to 0.
    <li>The upper bound starts as an infinite stream of bits set to 1.
    <li>The upper and lower bounds become closer as more symbols are encoded.
    <li>By restricting symbol probability ranges to N - 2 bits long,
    we can avoid impacting the bits beyond the N<sup>th</sup> in any given
    step.
    </ol>

    <p>As the lower and upper probability range bounds start to converge,
    they are likely to reach a point where the have identical MSBs (most
    significant bits).  Once the bounds have matching MSBs, the MSBs will
    remain matching for the rest of the encoding process.  From that point
    on we don't need to worry about the MSBs anymore.  Shift the MSB out to
    the encoded data stream, and shift in a 0 and a 1 for the LSBs of the
    lower and upper range limits respectively.  Since we didn't perform an
    operation that affects bits beyond the N<sup>th</sup>, we know the LSBs
    will be 0 and 1.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    Lower Range Bound = 1011010111001101<br>
    Upper Range Bound = 1101001001001100<br><br>

    Shift out the MSB (1) and write it to the encoded output<br><br>

    Lower Range Bound = 011010111001101?<br>
    Upper Range Bound = 101001001001100?<br><br>

    Shift in the new LSB<br><br>

    Lower Range Bound = 0110101110011010<br>
    Upper Range Bound = 1010010010011001
    </p>

    <h4>Underflow</h4>
    <p>Now that we have a rule for shifting bits through our N bit variables,
    We can do everything with N bit math.  Well almost.  It turns out there's
    one thing I overlooked.  What happens when the lower and upper range bounds
    start to converge around 1/2 (0111.... and 1000...)?  This condition is
    called an underflow condition.  When an underflow condition occurs the MSBs
    of the range bounds will never match.</p>

    <p>The good news is that there's a fairly simple way to handle underflow.
    We can recognize that an underflow condition is pending when the two MSBs of
    the lower range bound are different from the two MSBs of the upper range
    bound.  What we have to do in this situation is to remove the second bit
    from both range bounds, shift the other bits left, and remember that we had
    an underflow condition.  We may still have an underflow condition so this
    process may need to be repeated.  When we finally get an opportunity to
    shift out the MSB, follow it with the underflow bit(s) of the opposite
    value of the converged MSB.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    Lower Range Bound = 0111010111001101<br>
    Upper Range Bound = 1011001001001100<br><br>

    This is an underflow condition remove the second MSB and shift all the
    bits over.<br><br>

    Lower Range Bound = 0110101110011010<br>
    Upper Range Bound = 1110010010011001<br><br>

    Continue with encoding until MSBs match.<br><br>

    Lower Range Bound = 1011010111001101<br>
    Upper Range Bound = 1101001001001100<br><br>

    Write out the MSB (1) and underflow bit (0), and shift in the new LSB.
    <br><br>

    Lower Range Bound = 0110101110011010<br>
    Upper Range Bound = 1010010010011001
    </p>

    <h3>Stopping The Decoding Process</h3>
    <p>In my decoding <a href="#example2">example</a> I stated that a three
    symbol string should be decoded, but if you notice, there is still a coded
    value when we're done.  We stopped decoding because the problem said to only
    decode three symbols.</p>

    <p>One of the methods for knowing when to stop the decoding process is to
    include a symbol count somewhere in the encoded file.  The
    <a href="#file_header">file header</a> is an ideal place to store the symbol
    count.</p>

    <p>Another approach is to implement a &quot;bijective&quot; coder.  The
    idea of a &quot;bijective&quot; implementation seems like more a hassle
    than a benefit.  If you're interested in learning about
    &quot;bijective&quot; encoding/decoding refer to
    <a href="http://bijective.dogma.net/">SCOTT's
    &quot;one to one&quot; compression discussion</a>.</p>

    <p>I took the approach of encoding an <strong>EOF</strong>.  The upside is
    that I don't need to include a total symbol count in my header.  I don't
    even need to count <strong>EOF</strong>s, because there's only one.  The
    downsides are that the <strong>EOF</strong> does take up space in the
    probability line, and encoding the <strong>EOF</strong> may also add extra
    bits to the encoded file.</p>

    <p>I performed a few tests comparing including a total symbol count in the
    file header against encoding the <strong>EOF</strong>.  Encoding the
    <strong>EOF</strong> appeared to result in the better average compression
    ratios.  My testing was far from scientific.  If I get some time I will
    actually do a mathematical analysis of the two methods to determine when
    one method is better than the other.</p>

    <h3>Stopping the Encoding Process</h3>
    <p>Since I stop my encoding process after encoding the <strong>EOF</strong>
    it is at that point that I know the final probability range bounds.
    However, our probability range bounds have infinite precision and we need
    to write enough bits to be sure that the value we output falls within the
    range for the string we just encoded.  Since the decoder also uses N bits,
    we just need to make sure it will have N bits to work with when it decodes
    the <strong>EOF</strong>.  To do this, output the lower range bound's
    second MSB, all remaining underflow bits, plus an additional underflow bit.
    </p>

    <a name="model"></a>
    <h3>Static vs. Adaptive Models</h3>
    <p>The arithmetic coding algorithm is well suited for both static and
    adaptive probability models.  Encoders and decoders using adaptive
    probability models start with a fixed model and use a set of rules to adjust
    the model as symbols are encoded/decoded.  Encoders and decoders that use
    static symbol probability models start with a model that doesn't change
    during the encoding process.  Static probability models may be constant
    regardless of what is being encoded or they may be generated based on the
    encoded input.</p>

    <a name="file_header"></a>
    <h4>Static Model and File Headers</h4>
    <p>My static probability model implementation uses a file header.  Symbol
    probabilities are computed prior to the start of the encoding process and
    they are stored in a file header for the decoder to use at the start of the
    decoding process.</p>

    <p>The file header is section of data prior to the encoded output that
    includes <a href="#ranges">scaled range</a> counts for each encoded symbol
    (except the <b>EOF</b> whose count is always one).  Since I've scaled my
    counts to all be 14 bit values, I cheat a little and just write 14 bit
    values to the encoded file.  Handling the 14 bit values is only slightly
    more complicated than handling 16 bit values, and it makes the file 512
    bits smaller.</p>

    <a name="adaptive"></a>
    <h4>Adaptive Model and Symbol Range Updates</h4>
    <p>In the section on <a href="#ranges">Computing Probability Ranges</a> I
    touched on the potential need to rescale adaptive probability ranges and how
    I did it.  What I neglected to mention was why this happens and what it
    means.</p>

    <p>As its name would suggest, the adaptive model updates with the data
    stream.  I chose to update my model after a symbol is encoded or decoded.
    After a symbol is encoded or decoded, it's upper bound and the bounds of
    every symbol after it must be incremented by one.  On average that will be
    128 updates per an encode/decode in a 256 symbol alphabet.  Others have
    tried to reduce the number of updates required by placing the more common
    symbols near the end of the list of ranges.  Laziness and the my inability
    to see a great performance benefit kept me from trying that approach.</p>

    <p>If adding a new symbol causes the total probability to exceed N - 2 bits,
    the probability ranges must be <a href="#ranges">rescaled</a>.  One side
    effect of rescaling is that symbols encoded/decode after a rescale operation
    will have twice the weight of symbols encoded prior to the rescale (the
    weight of prior symbols is halved).  I have a feeling that this may be
    beneficial more often than not, but it's not intended to be a feature of my
    implementation.</p>

    <h3>Portability</h3>
    <p>All of the C source code that I have provided is written in strict
    ANSI C.  I would expect it to build correctly on any machine with an
    ANSI C compiler.  I have tested the code compiled with gcc on several Linux
    distributions as well as mingw on Windows XP.  (Un)fortunately I don't
    have a modern Windows system to test.</p>

    <p>There are some compile time options that offer minimal speed-up when
    compiling code for a little endian target, but the little endian code is
    disabled by default.</p>

    <p>My C implementation assumes that long integers (<code>long</code>) are
    bigger than short integers (<code>short</code>), if this is not the case
    with your compiler, a compile time error should be issued.</p>

    <p>The C implementation is also incapable of handling files with greater
    than <code>ULONG_MAX</code> bytes to be encoded.  The program will issue an
    error and gracefully terminate if the file being encoded is too large.
    </p>

    <p>The Python code was tested using Python 2.6 on Linux and Windows XP.
    It's possible that minor tweaks will be required to get the code to run
    properly using other versions of Python.</p>
