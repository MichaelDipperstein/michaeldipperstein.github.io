    <p>For some reason I keep finding myself dabbling in the worlds of
    compression and encryption.  I'm not an expert in either of these
    areas, nor do I aspire to become one.  It's just something that catches
    my interest from time to time.</p>

    <p>On computers, both compression and encryption usually take bit
    patterns with a given meaning and translate them to other patterns
    intended to have the same meaning.  This typically means having to
    read, write, and manipulate arbitrary groups of bits.  To save myself
    from reinventing the wheel every time I played with another compression
    or encryption algorithm, I developed two libraries: one for bitwise
    file reading and writing (<a href="#bitfile">bitfile</a>), and the
    other for manipulating arbitrary length arrays of bits
    (<a href="../bitarray.html">bitarray</a>).</p>

    <p>Some time ago I was asked to modify my
    <a href="../lzss.html">LZSS</a> implementation so it could be
    used on a SEGA Genesis without a file system, so I developed a bitwise
    array reading and writing library (arraystream).  Arraystream is very
    similar to bitfile, with the major exception being that it operates on
    arrays.</p>

    <p>I originally wrote the bitfile library in ANSI C, because I used C
    for my compression algorithms.  However, this library was one of just a
    few things that I ever wrote (I've written a lot) where I thought that I
    could do a better job with C++.  So I developed C++ implementations of my
    bitfile library.  For the time being, the arraystream library is exclusively
    available in C.</p>

    <p>I've been using <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> when I've
    needed quick hacks to do something on a PC (vs an embedded system).  After
    doing some searching of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">PYPI</a>, the
    Python Package Index, I noticed there were a number of Python packages
    that were similar to my bitarray library, but there wasn't anything that
    provided all the functionality of my bitfile library.  I had to fix
    that problem by providing a pure Python version of my bitfile library too.
    </p>

    <p>I am publishing all of these libraries under the
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#LGPL">GNU LGPL</a>
    in hopes that they will be of use to other people.</p>

    <p>The rest of this page discusses each of my libraries.</p>

    <a NAME="bitfile"></a><h2>Bitfile Library Overview</h2>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>Each version of the bitfile library provides a wrapper around the
    language's native file I/O.  The ANSI C version uses file I/O
    functions and every bitfile is referenced by a structure which includes
    a <code>FILE</code> pointer.</p>

    <p>The arraystream library uses a similar structure, replacing the
    <code>FILE</code> pointer with a pointer to an array of unsigned characters
    and an array index.  Arraystream operations are analogous to bitfile
    operations in almost all respects and will not be discussed further.</p>

    <p>The C++ version of the bitfile library makes use of (but does not
    inherit from) the <code>ifstream</code> and <code>ofstream</code> classes.
    Every bit file object contains an <code>ifstream</code> pointer and
    <code>ofstream</code> pointer.</p>

    <p>The Python version implements a class containing a Python file
    object.</p>

    <p>In addition to a reference to a native file, each library includes
    an 8-bit buffer, and counter responsible for tracking the number of
    bits in the 8-bit buffer.  The C and C++ versions of the bitfile
    library use an <code>unsinged char</code> for the 8-bit buffer.</p>

    <h4>Reading Bits</h4>
    <p>Reading bits from a bitfile works as follows:<br>

    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Read a byte from the underlying file and store it
    in the 8-bit buffer.<br>

    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Set the count of bits in the buffer to 8.<br>

    <strong>Step 3.</strong> Report the least significant bit (lsb) in the
    buffer as the bit read.<br>

    <strong>Step 4.</strong> Shift the buffer right by one bit.<br>

    <strong>Step 5.</strong> Decrement the count of bits in the buffer.</p>

    <p>To read an additional bit, repeat the process from
    <strong>Step 3</strong>.  Once all bits are read from the 8-bit buffer
    (the count equals 0) the process starts over from <strong>Step 1</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>Writing Bits</h4>
    <p>Writing bits to a bitfile works as follows:<br>

    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Left shift the 8-bit buffer by one bit.<br>

    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Set the least significant bit (lsb) of the 8-bit
    buffer to the value of the bit being written.<br>

    <strong>Step 3.</strong> Increment the count of bits in the 8-bit buffer.
    </p>

    <p>Repeat the process from <strong>Step 1</strong> for each additional bit.
    Once 8 bits have been written to the 8-bit buffer, the buffer is written to
    the underlying file and the bit count is set to 0.</p>

    <p>I have incorporated some short cuts that bypass the 8-bit buffer in the
    functions that read/write characters or bytes.</p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>Doxygen generated documentation of the ANSI C version of my bitfile
    library may be found in my repository's
    <a href="https://michaeldipperstein.github.io/bitfile/">
    docs directory</a></p>

    <p>The Python version of the bitfile library includes comments in docstring
    format.</p>

    <p>For the time being, there is no formal documentation for the C++
    version of the bitfile library or the arraystream library.  Feel free to
    generate some and send it to me.</p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>I have included a file named sample.[c|cpp|py] which demonstrates the
    usage of each function in the bitfile library and serves as a test to
    verify the correctness of the code.</p>
