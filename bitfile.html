<hr style="width:100%;">

<p>For some reason I keep finding myself dabbling in the worlds of
compression and encryption.  I'm not an expert in either of these
areas, nor do I aspire to become one.  It's just something that catches
my interest from time to time.</p>

<p>On computers, both compression and encryption usually take bit
patterns with a given meaning and translate them to other patterns
intended to have the same meaning.  This typically means having to
read, write, and manipulate arbitrary groups of bits.  To save myself
from reinventing the wheel every time I played with another compression
or encryption algorithm, I developed two libraries: one for bitwise
file reading and writing (<a href="#bitfile">bitfile</a>), and the
other for manipulating arbitrary length arrays of bits
(<a href="./bitarray.html">bitarray</a>).</p>

<p>Some time ago I was asked to modify my
<a href="./lzss.html">LZSS</a> implementation so it could be
used on a SEGA Genesis without a file system, so I developed a bitwise
array reading and writing library (arraystream).  Arraystream is very
similar to bitfile, with the major exception being that it operates on
arrays.</p>

<p>I originally wrote the bitfile library in ANSI C, because I used C
for my compression algorithms.  However, this library was one of just a
few things that I ever wrote (I've written a lot) where I thought that I
could do a better job with C++.  So I developed C++ implementations of my
bitfile library.  For the time being, the arraystream library is exclusively
available in C.</p>

<p>I've been using <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> when I've
needed quick hacks to do something on a PC (vs an embedded system).  After
doing some searching of <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PYPI</a>, the
Python Package Index, I noticed there were a number of Python packages
that were similar to my bitarray library, but there wasn't anything that
provided all the functionality of my bitfile library.  I had to fix
that problem by providing a pure Python version of my bitfile library too.
</p>

<p>I am publishing all of these libraries under the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#LGPL">GNU LGPL</a>
in hopes that they will be of use to other people.</p>

<p>The rest of this page discusses each of my libraries.</p>

<h2 id="bitfile">Bitfile Library Overview</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Each version of the bitfile library provides a wrapper around the
language's native file I/O.  The ANSI C version uses file I/O
functions and every bitfile is referenced by a structure which includes
a <code>FILE</code> pointer.</p>

<p>The arraystream library uses a similar structure, replacing the
<code>FILE</code> pointer with a pointer to an array of unsigned characters
and an array index.  Arraystream operations are analogous to bitfile
operations in almost all respects and will not be discussed further.</p>

<p>The C++ version of the bitfile library makes use of (but does not
inherit from) the <code>ifstream</code> and <code>ofstream</code> classes.
Every bit file object contains an <code>ifstream</code> pointer and
<code>ofstream</code> pointer.</p>

<p>The Python version implements a class containing a Python file
object.</p>

<p>In addition to a reference to a native file, each library includes
an 8-bit buffer, and counter responsible for tracking the number of
bits in the 8-bit buffer.  The C and C++ versions of the bitfile
library use an <code>unsinged char</code> for the 8-bit buffer.</p>

<h4>Reading Bits</h4>
<p>Reading bits from a bitfile works as follows:<br>

<strong>Step 1.</strong> Read a byte from the underlying file and store it
in the 8-bit buffer.<br>

<strong>Step 2.</strong> Set the count of bits in the buffer to 8.<br>

<strong>Step 3.</strong> Report the least significant bit (lsb) in the
buffer as the bit read.<br>

<strong>Step 4.</strong> Shift the buffer right by one bit.<br>

<strong>Step 5.</strong> Decrement the count of bits in the buffer.</p>

<p>To read an additional bit, repeat the process from
<strong>Step 3</strong>.  Once all bits are read from the 8-bit buffer
(the count equals 0) the process starts over from <strong>Step 1</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Writing Bits</h4>
<p>Writing bits to a bitfile works as follows:<br>

<strong>Step 1.</strong> Left shift the 8-bit buffer by one bit.<br>

<strong>Step 2.</strong> Set the least significant bit (lsb) of the 8-bit
buffer to the value of the bit being written.<br>

<strong>Step 3.</strong> Increment the count of bits in the 8-bit buffer.
</p>

<p>Repeat the process from <strong>Step 1</strong> for each additional bit.
Once 8 bits have been written to the 8-bit buffer, the buffer is written to
the underlying file and the bit count is set to 0.</p>

<p>I have incorporated some short cuts that bypass the 8-bit buffer in the
functions that read/write characters or bytes.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Doxygen generated documentation of the ANSI C version of my bitfile
library may be found in my repository's
<a href="https://michaeldipperstein.github.io/bitfile/">
docs directory</a></p>

<p>The Python version of the bitfile library includes comments in docstring
format.</p>

<p>For the time being, there is no formal documentation for the C++
version of the bitfile library or the arraystream library.  Feel free to
generate some and send it to me.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>I have included a file named sample.[c|cpp|py] which demonstrates the
usage of each function in the bitfile library and serves as a test to
verify the correctness of the code.</p>
