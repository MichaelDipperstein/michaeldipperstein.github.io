    <h1>Burrows-Wheeler Transform Discussion and Implementation</h1>
    <h3>by Michael Dipperstein</h3>
</div>

<hr style="width:100%;">

<p>After playing with:
<a href="./huffman.html">Huffman</a> coding,
<a href="./lzss.html">LZSS</a>,
<a href="./arithmetic.html">arithmetic</a> coding, and
run length encoding (<a href="./rle.html">RLE</a>), you'd figure that
I'd have enough.  I thought so too.  I briefly diverted my attention from
compression with a venture into C++ implementations of my
<a href="./bitfile.html">bit file</a> and
<a href="./bitarray.html">bit array</a> libraries, but compression
curiosities came back to haunt me.  I had long known about
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2">bzip2</a> and its better
compression ratios than gzip.  I even knew that the &quot;b&quot; is for
&quot;block&quot;, but I never really understood how it worked.  Where do
blocks come into play and how does that let me improve on my compression
ratios?</p>

<p>It turns out that the blocks are constructs of the Burrows-Wheeler
block-sorting transform (BWT).  This page discusses the Burrows-Wheeler
transform and the related Move-To-Front coding (MTF).  I have also provided
links to my implementation of BWT and MTF.</p>

<p>As with my compression implementations, my intent is to publish an
easy to follow ANSI C implementation of the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
Anyone familiar with ANSI C and BWT should be able to follow and learn from
my implementation.  There's a lot of room for improvement of speed, memory
usage, and block size optimizations, but this project is about learning and
sharing, not perfection.</p>

<p>If you just want my source code, click <a href="#download">here</a> for
information on downloading it.</p>

<p>The rest of this page discusses BWT, Move-To-Front coding and the results
of my efforts so far.</p>

<hr style="width:100%;">

<a ></a>
<h2 id="overview">Algorithm Overview</h2>
<p>The Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) is not actually a compression
algorithm.  In fact BWT requires that a small amount of additional
information be stored with the transformed data so that the transformation
may be reversed.  This makes the transformed data larger than its original
form.</p>

<p>BWT is useful because it converts the data into a format that is
generally more compressible by <a href="./rle.html">
run length encoders</a> and
statistical encoders with order greater than 0.  By additionally applying
<a href="#mtf">move-to-front</a> coding, the data will be in a format which
is generally more compressible by even zero order statistical encoders such
as traditional implementations of
<a href="./huffman.html">Huffman</a>
coding or <a href="./arithmetic.html">arithmetic</a> coding.</p>

<h3>Transform</h3>
<p>The Burrows-Wheeler transform is applied on blocks of input data
(symbols).  It is usually the case that larger blocks result in greater
compressibility of the transformed data at the expense of time and system
resources.</p>

<p>One of the effects of BWT is to produce blocks of data with more and
longer runs (strings of identical symbols) than those found in the original
data.  The increasing the number of runs and their lengths tends to improve
a the compressibility of data.</p>

<p>The first step of BWT is to read in a block of N symbols C<sub>0</sub>
&hellip; C<sub>N-1</sub>.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Read in the following block: <code>this is a test.</code></p>

<p>N = 15<br>
C<sub>0</sub> = 't'<br>
C<sub>1</sub> = 'h'<br>
&hellip;<br>
C<sub>13</sub> = 't'<br>
C<sub>14</sub> = '.'</p>

<p>The next step is to think of the block as a cyclic buffer.  N strings
(rotations) S<sub>0</sub> &hellip; S<sub>N-1</sub> may be constructed such
that:<br>
S<sub>0</sub> = C<sub>0</sub>, &hellip;, C<sub>N-1</sub><br>
S<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, C<sub>N-1</sub>, C<sub>0</sub><br>
S<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, C<sub>N-1</sub>, C<sub>0</sub>,
    C<sub>1</sub><br>
&hellip;<br>
S<sub>N-1</sub> = C<sub>N-1</sub>, C<sub>0</sub>, &hellip;, C<sub>N-2</sub>
</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
&quot;this is a test.&quot; yields the following rotations:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2pc;"><code>
    S<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;this is a test.&quot;<br>
    S<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;his is a test.t&quot;<br>
    S<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;is is a test.th&quot;<br>
    S<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;s is a test.thi&quot;<br>
    S<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot; is a test.this&quot;<br>
    S<sub>5</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;is a test.this &quot;<br>
    S<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;s a test.this i&quot;<br>
    S<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot; a test.this is&quot;<br>
    S<sub>8</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;a test.this is &quot;<br>
    S<sub>9</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot; test.this is a&quot;<br>
    S<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;= &quot;test.this is a &quot;<br>
    S<sub>11</sub>&nbsp;= &quot;est.this is a t&quot;<br>
    S<sub>12</sub>&nbsp;= &quot;st.this is a te&quot;<br>
    S<sub>13</sub>&nbsp;= &quot;t.this is a tes&quot;<br>
    S<sub>14</sub>&nbsp;= &quot;.this is a test&quot;<br>
</code></p>

<p>The third step of BWT is to lexicographically sort S<sub>0</sub>
&hellip; S<sub>N-1</sub>.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
&quot;this is a test.&quot; yields the following sorted rotations:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2pc;"><code>
    S<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot; a test.this is&quot;<br>
    S<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot; is a test.this&quot;<br>
    S<sub>9</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot; test.this is a&quot;<br>
    S<sub>14</sub>&nbsp;= &quot;.this is a test&quot;<br>
    S<sub>8</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;a test.this is &quot;<br>
    S<sub>11</sub>&nbsp;= &quot;est.this is a t&quot;<br>
    S<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;his is a test.t&quot;<br>
    S<sub>5</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;is a test.this &quot;<br>
    S<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;is is a test.th&quot;<br>
    S<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;s a test.this i&quot;<br>
    S<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;s is a test.thi&quot;<br>
    S<sub>12</sub>&nbsp;= &quot;st.this is a te&quot;<br>
    S<sub>13</sub>&nbsp;= &quot;t.this is a tes&quot;<br>
    S<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;= &quot;test.this is a &quot;<br>
    S<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &quot;this is a test.&quot;<br>
</code></p>

<p>The final step in the transform is to output a string, <code>L</code>,
consisting of the last character in each of the rotations in their sorted
order along with <code>I</code>, the sorted row containing S<sub>0</sub>.
</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
&quot;this is a test.&quot; yields the following output:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2pc;"><code>
    L = &quot;ssat tt hiies&nbsp;.&quot;, I = 14
</code></p>

<p>The input went from a block of 0 runs to a block of 3 runs of length 2
(not bad for 15 symbols).  This transformation works on data blocks where
there are symbols that are frequently preceded by the same symbol.  In
my example ' ' is twice preceded by 's'.</p>

<p>Believe it or not the string of last characters (<code>L</code>) along
with the row S<sub>0</sub> appears in after sorting (<code>I</code>) is
enough information to reconstruct the original block (S<sub>0</sub>).</p>

<h3>Reverse Transform</h3>
<p>Reversing BWT is a little more complicated than the initial transform.
The reversal process starts with a string <code>L</code> composed of last
characters of sorted rotations (S<sub>0</sub> &hellip; S<sub>N-1</sub>) and
<code>I</code>, the position of the contribution S<sub>0</sub> made to
<code>L</code>.  The reversal process must yield S<sub>0</sub>, the original
block.</p>

<p>The approach to reversing the transform wasn't the least bit obvious to
me.  If it's obvious to you, feel free to skip this section.</p>

<p>It turns out there are a few ways to reverse the transform.  The method
discussed here is the one that I ended up implementing.</p>

<p>If <code>L</code> is composed of the symbols V<sub>0</sub> &hellip;
V<sub>N-1</sub>, the transformed string may be parsed to determine the
following pieces of additional information:</p>

<ol>
<li>The number of symbols in the substring V<sub>0</sub> &hellip;
V<sub>i-1</sub> that are identical to V<sub>i</sub>.
<li>For each unique symbol, V<sub>i</sub>, in <code>L</code>, the number of
symbols that are lexicographically less than that symbol.
</ol>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
<code>L = &quot;ssat tt hiies .&quot;</code> produces the following:</p>

<p>Now we have:</p>
<ol>
    <li><code>L</code>, the string of last characters of rotations.
    <li><code>I</code>, the position of the contribution that S<sub>0</sub>
    made to <code>L</code>.
    <li>The number of times the symbol V<sub>i</sub> appears in the
    substring V<sub>0</sub> &hellip; V<sub>i-1</sub>.
    <li>The number of times a symbol lexicographically less than a unique
    symbol appears in <code>L</code>.
</ol>

<p>Amazingly this is all we need to reconstruct S<sub>0</sub>.</p>

<p>Remember our string S<sub>0</sub> = C<sub>0</sub> &hellip;
C<sub>N-1</sub>.  So C<sub>N-1</sub> is the contribution from S<sub>0</sub>,
and it's in position <code>I</code>. (From #2)</p>

<p>Now that we've found the last character in S<sub>0</sub>,
C<sub>N-1</sub>, we'll try to reconstruct the rest of S<sub>0</sub>
backwards.  (Trust me, there's a technique that will let us do that.)</p>

<p>That means we need to find the symbol C<sub>N-2</sub>.   C<sub>N-2</sub>
is the contribution from S<sub>N-1</sub>.  so where is contribution from
S<sub>N-1</sub> in <code>L</code>?</p>

<p>It just so happens that S<sub>N-1</sub> is the string that starts with
C<sub>N-1</sub> and we just found C<sub>N-1</sub>.  So we know how
S<sub>N-1</sub> starts, which can help us find out where it is in the
sort order.</p>

<p>The contributions from strings starting with symbols less than
C<sub>N-1</sub> will occur earlier in <code>L</code> than the contribution
from S<sub>N-1</sub>.  <code>L</code> may also contain contributions from
strings starting with symbols equal to C<sub>N-1</sub>.  Some of these
strings occur before S<sub>N-1</sub> and others after.</p>

<p>From #3, we know the number of symbols identical to C<sub>N-1</sub> that
occur in <code>L</code> before C<sub>N-1</sub>.  So we also know the number
of strings starting with identical symbols that made contributions before
S<sub>N-1</sub>.</p>

<p>From #4, we know how many symbols there are that are less than
C<sub>N-1</sub>.  So we also know the number of strings starting with lesser
symbols that made contributions before S<sub>N-1</sub>.</p>

<p>No other strings may contribute to <code>L</code> before S<sub>N-1</sub>,
therefore the contribution from S<sub>N-1</sub> occurs in the position
obtained by summing the values from #3 and #4.  As stated earlier the
contribution from S<sub>N-1</sub> is C<sub>N-2</sub>.</p>

<p>Use the same technique to find C<sub>N-3</sub>, C<sub>N-4</sub>,
&hellip;, C<sub>0</sub>.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Using tables <a href="#table1">1</a> and <a href="#table2">2</a> reverse BWT
where <code>L = &quot;ssat tt hiies .&quot;</code> and <code>I</code> = 14.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2pc;">We start with:<br>
S<sub>0</sub> = <code>???????????????</code><br><br>

We're given that C<sub>14</sub> is V<sub>14</sub> = '.'.<br>
S<sub>0</sub> = <code>??????????????.</code><br><br>

Table 1 tells us that there are 0 other '.' before V<sub>14</sub> and Table 2
tells us that there are 3 characters &lt; '.', so C<sub>14</sub>
must be V<sub>0 + 3</sub> = V<sub>3</sub> = 't'.<br>
S<sub>0</sub> = <code>?????????????t.</code><br><br>

Table 1 tells us that there are 0 other 't' before V<sub>3</sub> and Table 2
tells us that there are 12 characters &lt; 't', so C<sub>13</sub>
must be V<sub>0 + 12</sub>  = V<sub>12</sub> = 's'.<br>
S<sub>0</sub> = <code>????????????st.</code><br><br>

Table 1 tells us that there are 2 other 's' before V<sub>12</sub> and Table 2
tells us that there are 9 characters &lt; 's', so C<sub>12</sub>
must be V<sub>9 + 2</sub>  = V<sub>11</sub> = 'e'.<br>
S<sub>0</sub> = <code>???????????est.</code><br><br>

Table 1 tells us that there are 0 other 'e' before V<sub>11</sub> and Table 2
tells us that there are 5 characters &lt; 'e', so C<sub>11</sub>
must be V<sub>0 + 5</sub>  = V<sub>5</sub> = 't'.<br>
S<sub>0</sub> = <code>??????????test.</code><br><br>

Table 1 tells us that there is 1 other 't' before V<sub>5</sub> and Table 2
tells us that there are 12 characters &lt; 't', so C<sub>10</sub>
must be V<sub>1 + 12</sub>  = V<sub>13</sub> = ' '.<br>
S<sub>0</sub> = <code>????????? test.</code><br><br>

Table 1 tells us that there is 2 other ' ' before V<sub>13</sub> and Table 2
tells us that there are 0 characters &lt; ' ', so C<sub>9</sub>
must be V<sub>2 + 0</sub>  = V<sub>2</sub> = 'a'.<br>
S<sub>0</sub> = <code>????????a test.</code><br><br>

&hellip;</p>

<p>The rest is left as an exercise to the student.  (I always loved that
statement)</p>

<h3 id="whatbwt">So What Do I Do with BWT?</h3>
<p>Now that you understand BWT, you can publish web pages about it.  Okay,
that's not what you're looking for.</p>

<p>As I stated <a href="#overview">earlier</a> BWT tends to transform blocks
of symbols into blocks with more runs.  This makes BWT useful for improving
compression of <a href="./rle.html">run length encoders</a>.  The
method for compression would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply Burrows-Wheeler Transform on data to be encoded.
<li>Apply run length encoding on data to be encoded.
</ol>

<p>The method for decompression would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove run length encoding on from the encoded data.
<li>Apply the reverse Burrows-Wheeler Transform on the encoded data.
</ol>

<p>Typically compression performed by run length encoders are far from
optimal.  Even after BWT, run length encoders don't perform as well as
statistical encoders.  BWT doesn't do anything to change the frequency
distribution of symbols, so BWT alone won't do anything to make data more
compressible by order zero statistical algorithms.  That's where
Move-To-Front Coding comes into play.</p>

<h3 id="mtf">Move-To-Front Coding</h3>
<p>Move-To-Front (MTF) coding is a technique that encodes streams of symbols
based on an adapting code.  Imagine that symbols are encoded by their
position in a list of every symbol in the alphabet.  Initially the list is
in a lexicographical (or some predetermined) order.  Once a symbol in a
stream is encoded, that symbol is moved from it's current position to the
front of the list and its former predecessors are moved one position back.
</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Given an alphabet of ' ','.','a','e','h','i','s','t' encode
&quot;ssat tt hiies .&quot;:</p>

<p>Notice that with MTF coding, the second and successive characters in any
run are converted to 0 (&quot;ss&quot; became 6,0, &quot;tt&quot; became
1,0, and &quot;ii&quot; became 7,0).  This works well with BWT, since it
produces blocks with a lot of runs.  You should also notice that there is
nothing about MTF coding that requires prior use of BWT.</p>

<h3>Move-To-Front Decoding</h3>
<p>Unlike the reverse BWT, Move-To-Front (MTF) decoding was fairly obvious
to me.  It's very much like the encoding process, but a little less time
intensive.  This time the position of a symbol in the list of every symbol
in the alphabet is used to decode a symbol.  Like the encode process,
the list starts out in a lexicographical (or some predetermined) order.
The encoded data indicates the position of the decoded symbol.  After
decoding the symbol, move it to the front of the list.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Given an alphabet of ' ','.','a','e','h','i','s','t' decode
6,0,3,7,3,1,0,1,6,7,0,7,6,4,7:</p>

<h3 id="whatmtf">So What Do I Do with MTF?</h3>
<p>Now that you understand MTF, you can publish web pages about it too.
Okay, it was a bad joke the first time.</p>

<p>As I stated <a href="#whatbwt">earlier</a> MTF tends to increase the
frequency of low value symbols within a block.  This makes MTF useful for
improving compression of statistical encoders such as
<a href="./huffman.html">Huffman</a> coding or
<a href="./arithmetic.html">arithmetic</a> coding.</p>

<p>The method for compression would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply Burrows-Wheeler Transform on data to be encoded.
<li>Apply Move-To-Front encoding on data to be encoded.
<li>Apply statistical encoding on data to be encoded.
</ol>

<p>The method for decompression would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove statistical from the encoded data.
<li>Remove Move-To-Front encoding from the encoded data.
<li>Apply the reverse Burrows-Wheeler Transform on the encoded data.
</ol>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>I was extremely uncreative here.  My implementation comes directly from
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/SRC-RR-124.pdf">
&quot;A Block-sorting Lossless Data Compression Algorithm&quot;</a> by
Michael Burrows and David Wheeler.  The source code includes comments which
reference sections of their paper.  My hope is that anybody reading their
paper will be able to follow along with my source.  This section addresses
issues that were either discussed by Burrows and Wheeler or were required to
implement their transform on real data.</p>

<h3>Block Size</h3>
<p>BWT is a block sorting algorithm, but the transform isn't dependent upon
the size of the block.  BWT can be used on blocks of any size.  When I was
debugging my code I used 16 byte blocks, they are currently 4096 bytes.  I
chose 4096 bytes because it can be handled by most modern computers.  The
larger the block, the more opportunity you have for runs and repeated
patterns.  Burrows and Wheeler demonstrate improved compression ratios all
the way to 103 megabyte blocks for one benchmark file.</p>

<p>The obvious downsides to large blocks are that blocks must be stored
somewhere, so you need enough memory to hold the block and it's rotations.
An N byte block will have N rotations.  The rotations are also sorted, and
sorting is not a linear operation; larger blocks will also take more time.
</p>

<h3>End Of Block</h3>
<p>In the ideal world any encoded data will be evenly divisible by whatever
block size the transform happens to be using.  Unfortunately, I don't live
in that world.  More often than not, the last block is a partial block.
There are a few ways to deal with this that I can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefix the encoded data stream with a number of bytes encoded
<li>Encode an End-of-Block symbol into each block
<li>Prefix each block with a block size
<li>Use EOF to indicate end of last block
</ul>

<p>When I started playing with BWT I thought that I might want to
dynamically adjust the block size, so I prefixed each block with its size.
It also allowed for some error checking.  If the file ended before I read
all the data in a block something bad happened.  The dynamic block size
adjustment never came into being, so the code I'm releasing actually takes
the more compact approach of using the EOF as an indicator of a partial
block.</p>

<p>In order to handle a partial block at the end of a file, I made one minor
change to the BWT algorithm.  Burrows and Wheeler output the last characters
of the sorted rotations (<code>L</code>), followed by the index of the
contribution of the unrotated block (<code>I</code>).  If <code>L</code> is
written before <code>I</code>, an attempt to read all the characters of a
full size block will result in reading some or all of <code>I</code> before
the EOF is reached.  <code>L</code> can always be adjusted by removing the
data that belongs to <code>I</code>, but there's an easier approach.  My
implementation writes <code>I</code> then <code>L</code>.  If we hit an EOF
and <code>L</code> is a partial block we don't need to do any magic to get
<code>I</code>; we already have it.</p>

<h3>Block Rotations</h3>
<p>Burrows and Wheeler discuss a conceptual N &times; N matrix containing
rotations of N long blocks, but they leave implementation of the concept
to the implementer.  I'm pretty sure they don't expect anybody to use an
actual N &times; N matrix.</p>

<p>Since rotations are just strings starting at index i in the block and
wrapping around until, index (i - 1) mod N, I just refer to my rotations by
their starting indices.  My matrix of rotations is just an array of induces
into the unrotated block.</p>

<h3>Sorting of Rotations</h3>
<p>In order to keep things simple, I use the <code>qsort()</code> function
to sort rotations.  The efficiency of <code>qsort()</code> really depends
upon your compiler.  You'd think it was just a text book quick sort, but it
isn't always.  I think gcc uses a merge sort.</p>

<p>If you want to play with different sort functions, my
<a href="./sort.html">sort library</a> includes implementations of
common sort algorithms which are plug-in replacements for
<code>qsort()</code>.</p>

<p>It turns out that the sorting of rotations is one of the most time
consuming steps in the encode process.  Optimizing the sorting process seems
to be a pretty hot topic, with several published papers.  Burrows and
Wheeler suggest optimizing the process by using a
<a href="./sort.html#RadixSort">radix sort</a> to sort all rotations
by their first two characters.  Then using quick sort is use to sort within
the groups of rotations that match at their first two characters.
Versions 0.4 and later of my software introduce this optimization.</p>

<p>It should be pointed out that using a radix sort to sort rotations by
their first two characters prior using quick sort isn't always more optimal
than using quicksort alone.  Suppose an entire block is just one repeated
character.  All rotations in that block start with the same two characters,
so a radix sort of such a block will not reduce the amount of comparisons
performed by quick sort.</p>

<h3>MTF Encode/Decode</h3>
<p>My implementation of MTF encode/decode uses brute force.  Apparently
there are efficient implementations of MTF that are well known.  Not by me,
but I didn't go looking for them either.  One possible area to look for
optimization is in the search for a symbol's code during the encode process.
I do a sequential search.  It will find the code for a symbol in a run on
the first try.  The average search time for other symbols will be on the
order of half the alphabet length.  Other searches might have better average
cases.</p>

<p>Another potential from optimization is the Move-To-Front operation
itself.  My code is stored in an array, and I move each character over one
at a time.  Linked lists will make the move faster, but then you can't use
the array index as the code.</p>

<h3>Portability</h3>
<p>All the source code that I have provided is written in strict ANSI C.  I
would expect it to build correctly on any machine with an ANSI C compiler.
I have tested the code compiled with gcc on Linux and
<a href="../free.html#gcc">mingw</a> on Windows 98/XP.</p>

<p>My implementation defines a value <code>BLOCK_SIZE</code> as 4096.  This
value may easily be changed.  Increasing <code>BLOCK_SIZE</code> generally
improves the compressibility of transformed data at the expense of memory
and computation time.  If <code>BLOCK_SIZE</code> is made larger than
<code>INT_MAX</code> the preprocessor will issue and error which may be
corrected by changing several <code>int</code>s to <code>long</code>s.  If
<code>BLOCK_SIZE</code> is made larger than the maximum <code>size_t</code>,
I would expect calls to <code>fread()</code> and <code>fwrite()</code> to
produce errors.  Whether the errors are compile-time or run-time is probably
dependent on the compiler.</p>
