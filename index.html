<hr style="width:100%;">

<p>Welcome to my GitHub project site.  I've been a professional software
engineer since 1990.  If I was a really good software engineer, I'd have
a dynamically updating counter displaying how many years that is.
However, the bulk of my experience is with real-time embedded systems,
not web page design.</p>

<p>Absolutely none of the code on this site has anything to do with
any of my professional work.  It's all hobby work.  I went through a
period when I was playing with data compression for a while and the results
have become a large part of this site.  I hope some of my hobby work may
actually be of use to you.</p>

<p>For those of you that insist my web page would not be complete
without a picture of me, just scroll down a bit.  I'm the human.  The statue
is an <a href="https://www.mlb.com/dodgers">LA Dodgers</a> pig.  The venue
is Dodger Stadium.  The picture was taken before the start of the 2014 LA
Marathon.</p>

<img src="img/meandpig.jpg"
style="border:0px; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
alt="Me at the LA Marathon next to a Dodgers pig" width="512">

<p>I've run a bunch of half marathons and marathons before and after the one
in the photo.  There are photos of me from every one of those runs, most
of the other photos have me with distorted facial expressions.  If you think
the picture above is bad, you should see the others.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or nothing better to do, feel free to
e-mail me at <a href="mailto:mdipperstein@gmail.com">
mdipperstein@gmail.com</a>.  Who knows, maybe your e-mail will
become part of my stuff.</p>
