        <h1>A Discussion of Sorting Algorithms and Their Implementation</h1>
        <h3>by Michael Dipperstein</h3>
    </div>

    <hr style="width:100%;">

    <p>The more basic stuff I publish source for, the more requests for source I
    seem to get.  This time my <a href="../huffman/index.html">
    Huffman code page</a> landed me a request for C++ code which implements
    Huffman coding and merge sort.  The request obviously came from a student
    trying to get me to do his/her homework.  I didn't do the homework
    assignment, but it started me thinking about sorting algorithms, and
    off I went on a trip down sorting memory lane.</p>

    <p>I thought that I could put everything to rest after reading about some of
    the algorithms I remembered the names of.  After all, there are people that
    have made a career out of studying sorting algorithms, what would I want to
    do that hadn't already been done?  I thought wrong, there's a lot of
    discussion about the algorithms, and even some code.  Most of the code I
    saw had errors.  Other code snippets were just obfuscated by object oriented
    programming techniques.  So I decided to write my own library of sorting
    algorithms.</p>

    <p>As time goes on, I continue to discover new algorithms and sometimes even
    add them to my library.  I recently discovered the
    <a href="#RadixSort">Radix Sort</a> while reading about optimizations to the
    <a href="../bwt/index.html">Burrows-Wheeler Transformation</a>.
    I'm sure I'll find another sort to add in the future.</p>

    <p>The rest of this page discusses some of the issues concerning the sorting
    algorithms that I chose to implement.</p>

    <p>Click <a href="#download">here</a> to skip the discussion and go to
    instructions on downloading my sorting library.</p>

    <hr style="width:100%;">

    <h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>

    <p>There are several popular and well researched sorting algorithms.  My
    sort library implements the traditional version of the following algorithms:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="#InsertionSort">Insertion Sort</a>
        <li><a href="#BubbleSort">Bubble Sort</a>

        <li><a href="#HeapSort">Heap Sort</a>
        <li><a href="#RadixSort">Radix Sort</a>
    </ul>

    <p>Each of the algorithms has the following order of operations:</p>

    <table style="width:100%;" border="1" summary="order of operations">
    <tr>
        <th></th>

    </table>

    <a name="InsertionSort"></a>
    <h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
    <p>Insertion sort is probably the first sorting algorithm that is taught in
    programming classes.  It is far from efficient in terms of the number of
    comparisons, but is very compact in terms of code space required.  As such,
    the insertion sort algorithm may be useful for sorting small lists.</p>

    <p>Insertion sort is an iterative algorithm that makes n - 1 passes on a
    list of n items.  On the first pass the second item in the unsorted list is
    inserted in the proper position for a sorted list containing the first two
    items.  The next pass, the third item is inserted in a the proper position
    for a list sorted list containing the first three items.  After the
    k<sup>th</sup> iteration the first k + 1 items in the list are in
    sorted order.  The algorithm continues until the n<sup>th</sup> item
    is inserted into its position.</p>

    <p>The insertion sort algorithm is implemented by my
    <a href="#download">sort library</a> function <code>InsertionSort</code>.
    </p>

    <a name="BubbleSort"></a>
    <h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
    <p>When I first learned the bubble sort algorithm, it was described as
    &quot;cute&quot;.  I believe that cuteness is the only thing this algorithm
    has going for it.  It typically requires the same order of operations as
    insertion sort, and is not any more code efficient.</p>

    <p>Bubble sort is an iterative algorithm that makes n - 1 passes on a list
    of n items.  On the first pass, bubble sort starts at the head of the list
    and compares the first two items, if the items are out of order, they are
    swapped, then the second and third items are compared and swapped if
    necessary.  The comparison and swapping continue to the end of the list.
    After the first iteration, the largest item is in the n<sup>th</sup>
    position.</p>

    <p>The algorithm repeats itself, stopping one item earlier each pass.  The
    algorithm completes when only the first two items are compared.  This sort
    library includes an additional optimization which will halt the algorithm on
    any pass which finds the list to be already sorted (no swaps are performed).
    </p>

    <p>The bubble sort algorithm is implemented by my <a href="#download">sort
    library</a> function <code>BubbleSort</code>.</p>

    <a name="ShellSort"></a>
    <h3>Shell Sort</h3>
    <p>Shell sort is an optimization of the <a href="#InsertionSort">insertion
    sort</a> proposed by D. L. Shell.  Shell observed that performing an
    insertion sort on sublist of items that are separated by some distance (an
    <i>increment</i>) may allow items to be moved further across the list.</p>

    <p>For a list of n items [x<sub>1</sub> &hellip; x<sub>n</sub>], select an
    increment, i, and start by sorting the resulting n/i sub lists:<br>
    [x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>i + 1</sub>, x<sub>2i + 1</sub>, &hellip;],<br>
    [x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>i + 2</sub>, x<sub>2i + 2</sub>, &hellip;], &hellip;<br>
    [x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>i + i</sub>, x<sub>2i + i</sub>, &hellip;].</p>

    <p>Next decrease i and repeat the process until i equals 1.  At the time of
    my writing this, no optimal increment value is known.  However, D.E. Knuth
    has demonstrated that using increments of the form (3<sup>k</sup> - 1) / 2
    results in an O(n<sup>3/2</sup>) Shell sort.</p>

    <p>The Shell sort algorithm is implemented by my <a href="#download">sort
    library</a> function <code>ShellSort</code>.  The Shell sort function
    provided in this library uses increments of the form
    (3<sup>k</sup> - 1) / 2.</p>

    <a name="QuickSort"></a>
    <h3>Quick Sort</h3>
    <p>ANSI C provides a quick sort function, <code>qsort</code> in
    <code>stdlib.h</code>, yet I felt compelled to include a quick sort function
    in my library.</p>

    <p>Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm with two phases, a partition
    phase and a sort phase.</p>

    <p>In the partition phase list of two or more elements are partitioned into
    two smaller lists.  All list items less than or equal to a <em>pivot</em>
    item are placed in one partition, while all items greater than a
    <em>pivot</em> are placed in another partition.  For my implementation, I
    always designate the first item in the list as the <em>pivot</em>.
    To partition, I maintain left and right search pointers and perform the
    following steps.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Start the left search pointer at the second item
    in the list and the right pointer at the last item in the list.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Step 2.</strong> Move the left
    pointer to the right until it finds an item greater than the <em>pivot</em>
    or points to the same item as the right pointer.</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 4pc;">
        <li>If the left pointer crosses the right pointer, partition the list at
        the crossing point and quit.
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Step 3.</strong> Move the right
    pointer left until it crosses the left pointer or finds an item less than or
    equal to the <em>pivot</em>.</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 4pc;">
        <li>If the right pointer crosses the left pointer, partition the list at
        the crossing point and quit.
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Swap the items pointed to by the two pointers
    and go to step 2.</p>

    <p>The sort phase is really simple.  Just call the quick sort function
    twice, once passing the left partition as the list to be sorted, then
    passing the right partition as the list to be sorted.</p>

    <p>Quick sort has an average order of operation of O(n &times; log(n)), but
    when the partitions are not anywhere near even, the order of operation
    approaches O(n<sup>2</sup>).  For sorted lists and reverse sorted lists
    quick sort is an O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm.</p>

    <p>My <a href="#download">sort library</a> function <code>QuickSort</code>
    implements the quick sort algorithm.  It is a recursive implementation of
    quick sort which makes it pretty inefficient with stack space.  The stack
    space consumed may be equal to the size of the list.  A web search should
    reveal several memory optimizations for quick sort.</p>

    <a name="MergeSort"></a>
    <h3>Merge Sort</h3>
    <p>Like <a href="#QuickSort">quick sort</a>, merge sort is a divide and
    conquer algorithm with two phases.  In the case of merge sort, the phases
    are a partition phase, and a merge phase.</p>

    <p>In the partition phase, if the list of items to be sorted contains more
    than one item, the list is split in half and the merge sort algorithm is
    applied on each half of the list.</p>

    <p>At the end of the partition phase, the algorithm has two sorted list
    halves.  The merge phase merges the two sorted halves into one list.  For my
    implementation of this algorithm, I perform the merge by allocating a block
    of memory equal to the size of the combined lists, and merge the lists into
    the new memory block.  Allocation of a new memory block means that this
    implementation requires additional storage space equal to the size of the
    original list.</p>

    <p>To merge two lists, compare the lowest value in one list with the lowest
    value in the other list.  Remove the lowest of the two values from its list
    and place it at the end of the merged list.  Repeat this process until there
    are no more items in either list.</p>

    <p>Unlike <a href="#QuickSort">quick sort</a>, merge sort always partitions
    the list in half, so it is always an order O(n &times; log(n)) algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>The merge sort algorithm is implemented by my <a href="#download">sort
    library</a> function <code>MergeSort</code>.</p>

    <a name="HeapSort"></a>
    <h3>Heap Sort</h3>
    <p>Heap sort a popular in place O(n &times; log(n)) sort algorithm.  Unlike
    <a href="#QuickSort">quick sort</a> and <a href="#MergeSort">merge sort</a>,
    heap sort does not require additional memory allocations to store pieces of
    the list being sorted.</p>

    <p>Heap sort is a two phase algorithm, it has a heap building phase and a
    promotion phase.  A heap is a binary tree with the propriety that every node
    is greater than it's children.  For a list of 1 .. N items this means that
    item i is greater than it's children, items (i / 2) and ((i / 2) + 1).</p>

    <p>Once the heap is built, the largest item will be at the root of the heap.
    To sort, simply swap the first item in the list with N<sup>th</sup> item in
    the list.  Next rebuild the heap with items 1 .. (N - 1).  Repeat the
    process of swapping and rebuilding the heap with one less item, until only
    two items remain.</p>

    <p>The heap sort algorithm is implemented by my <a href="#download">sort
    library</a> function <code>HeapSort</code>.</p>

    <a name="RadixSort"></a>
    <h3>Radix Sort</h3>
    <p>Radix sort is an unusual sort algorithm.  All the sort algorithms
    discussed so far compare the elements being sorted to eachother.  The radix
    sort doesn't.  A radix sort uses one or more keys to sort values.  The key
    of a value indicates the sort grouping for a value on a particular pass.
    Successive passes with different keys may be used to sort a list of
    elements.</p>

    <p>On a radix sort pass, a list of items to be sorted is processed from
    beginning to end.  One at a time, the items in the list are placed at the
    end of a list of items with the same key value.  After all items have been
    processed, the lists of key values are reassembled smallest key to largest
    key.</p>

    <p>A somewhat intuitive example of how to use a radix sort might be
    alphabetizing strings of length N.  Each pass of the radix sort should use a
    character in the string as it's key.  The less intuitive part about
    alphabetizing is that radix sort passes should be from performed from the
    last character to the first character.  The first pass will use the
    N<sup>th</sup> character, the second pass will use the (N - 1)<sup>th</sup>
    character, &hellip;, the N<sup>th</sup> pass will use the first character.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sorting 3 Character Strings (start with third
    character).  Each cell represents a bin.</p>
    <table summary="Character Radix Sort" border="1">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Unsorted</td>
            <td>vbn</td>
            <td>asd</td>
            <td>qwd</td>
            <td>vgy</td>
            <td>qaz</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>First Pass</td>
            <td colspan="2">asd qwd</td>
            <td>vbn</td>
            <td>vgy</td>
            <td>qaz</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Second Pass</td>

            <td>qwd</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Third Pass</td>
            <td>asd</td>

            <td>qwd</td>
            <td colspan="2">vbn vgy</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Sorting unsigned integers is similar to sorting strings.  If we use a
    radix of 10, we can sort integers one digits at a time.  Like strings,
    integers should be sorted least significant digit to most significant
    digit.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sorting 4 Digit Integers (start with least
    significant digit).  Each cell represents a bin.</p>
    <table summary="Integer Radix Sort" border="1">

    <p>Pierre Terdiman's article
    <a href="http://codercorner.com/RadixSortRevisited.htm">
    Radix Sort Revisited</a> discusses radix sort techniques for sorting
    signed integers and floating point values.</p>

    <p>The radix sort algorithm is implemented by my <a href="#download">sort
    library</a> function <code>RadixSort</code>.  Each time
    <code>RadixSort</code> is called, it makes two passes on the data being
    sorted.  The first pass counts the number of values with each possible key,
    the second pass places the data in its sorted order.  Counting the number of
    values for each key allows the data to be sorted into a fixed size array
    instead of a linked list or similar data structure.</p>

    <a name="usage"></a>
    <h3>Function Usage</h3>
    <p>The <a href="#download">library archive</a> that I have provided includes
    a program file, sample.c, which demonstrates the usage of each sort
    function.  I have also provided the function <code>VerifySort</code> which
    may be used to determine if a list is actually sorted.  All of my sort
    functions share the same parameter list as the <code>qsort</code> function
    provided by <code>stdlib.h</code>:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A pointer to the list of items to be sorted
        <li>The number of items in the list
        <li>The size of the list items
        <li>A pointer to a comparison function
    </ul>

    <p>By utilizing the same format, code which calls <code>qsort</code> may be
    modified to use use my functions simply by changing the function name.
    Conversely, code that uses my functions may be made to use
    <code>qsort</code> simply by changing the function name.</p>

    <p>It is possible to sacrifice flexibility for speed by rewriting the
    functions so that a fixed comparison is performed inline instead of
    calling the comparison function passed as a parameter.  Greater speed
    may also be obtained by using arrays of a known type instead of void
    pointers with an item size determined at runtime.</p>

    <h2>Portability</h2>
    <p>The source code that I have provided is written in ANSI C.  It should
    work on any system with an ANSI C compiler.</p>

    <h2>Known Bugs</h2>
    <p>I have received a report that sorting large sets (&gt;2<sup>24</sup>
    values) of 64-bit integers frequently fails when attempted on PowerPC system
    running 64-bit Linux.  I have been unable to duplicate the problem on 32-bit
    x86 platforms and do not have a 64-bit platform to test on.</p>

    <p>Another error may occur when the number of bytes being sorted exceeds the
    capacity of <code>size_t</code>.</p>
