<hr style="width:100%;">

<p>Welcome to my MSCS project page.  This page contains links to
repositories of some of the projects that I worked on as part of the
coursework for an MSCS.  The work is pretty old (I worked on the
degree between 1995 and 2000) and the work is becoming increasingly
irrelevant, but maybe you'll find something useful.</p>

<p>If you can't get enough of my projects, check out the links in the
column on the right for some of the other stuff I've published.</p>

<p>If you have nothing better to do, you can e-mail me at
<a href="mailto:mdipperstein@gmail.com">mdipperstein@gmail.com
</a></p>

<h2 id="atm">Database Consistency Project</h2>
<p>This project was created with the help of Kevin O'Gorman
(<a href="mailto:kogorman@cs.ucsb.edu">kogorman@cs.ucsb.edu</a>)</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The ATM Simulation program consists of three independent components:
the User Interface, the Web-Monitor, and the Data Repositories (Bank
Branches). The components of the ATM Simulation are layered such that the
User Interface lies on top of the Web-Monitor, which lies on top of the
Data Repositories. Each component of the ATM Simulation communicates
only with the component layered above it and the component layered below it.
Each component is also designed so that it may be monitored and
debugged through a web browser outside of the regular program operation.</p>

</p>

<h3>Project Source</h3>

<p>The ATM project source may be cloned or downloaded from this GitHub
repository:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/michaeldipperstein/atm">
https://github.com/michaeldipperstein/atm</a>.</p>

<p>The source is written in a combination of PERL
script and HTML.  The PERL script files are in the repository's
<code>cgi</code> subdirectory.  The HTML are in the repository's
<code>html</code> subdirectory.<br><br>

After cloning or downloading the repository:</p>

<ol style="padding-left: 4pc;">
<li>Copy the files from the <code>cgi</code> subdirectory to the directory
where your server executes cgi.
<li>Copy the files from the <code>html</code> subdirectory to the directory
where you keep you HTML files.
<li>Edit all the links in the PERL files to point to there new home.
<li>Edit all the links in the HTML files to point to there new home.
</ol>

<p style="padding-left: 2pc;font-style: italic;">
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The PERL scripts use semaphores and shared
memory.  Not all PERL distributions provide support for semaphores and
shared memory.  It's possible to use files instead of shared memory, and
file renaming as a means of obtaining a semaphore (lock).</p>

<h2>Real-time UDP Data Mixer</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This project was written in the latter half of a 10 week course on
computer networks.  The goal of the project is to demonstrate some of the
techniques that may be used in real-time mixing of UDP data over the
current IP network.  It also sheds some light on areas that require advance
consideration before a given data mixing service is implemented.  Such
areas include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>mixing method</li>
    <li>mixing rate</li>
    <li>packet ordering</li>
    <li>lost packet handling</li>
    <li>joining mixing group</li>
    <li>leaving mixing group</li>
    <li>mixer resource allocation</li>
</ul>


<h3>Project Papers</h3>

<p>I quickly threw together this brief
<a href="https://michaeldipperstein.github.io/mixer/index.html">
description of the project objectives and source code</a> back in 2000.
hopefully it's good enough to get the job done, because the source and
it's comments are my only other documentation.</p>

<h3>Project Source</h3>

<p>The mixer source is written to build and execute on a Solaris 2.6
workstation.  I vaguely remember running it on a machine with a 32-bit
x86 Linux 2.2 kernel, but I may have just <code>telnet</code>ed to the
Solaris machine form there.</p>

<p>The UDP mixer project source may be cloned or downloaded from this GitHub
repository:<br>

<h2>Porting and Analysis of SPLASH-2 Ocean Current Simulation</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This project provides information on the lessons learned and the results
of an attempt to translate the Stanford Parallel Applications for Shared
Memory (SPLASH-2) ocean simulation program (Ocean) to both Pthread an MPI
implementations. Ocean is one of several applications in the SPLASH-2
library, intended to benchmark performance on various systems. Initially I
set out to use the Ocean program to compare Pthread and MPI performance on
both an SGI Origin 2000 and a Cray T3E.  Though I did not accomplish my
goals, there are still several valuable lessons learned to report along the
way.</p>

<p>The ocean project source and documentation may be cloned or downloaded
from this GitHub repository:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/michaeldipperstein/ocean">

<p>The source is written to operate on an SGI Origin 2000, though I have
executed the p-thread version on a Solaris machine.</p>

<p>Libraries converting many of the ANL PARMACS macros for use with
pthreads, MPI, and fork with shm on the SGI Origin 2000 are include in the
GitHub repository.</p>

<h2>Survey of Nucleotide (DNA) Database Search Techniques</h2>
<p>This project was created with the help of Matt Maxel
(<a href="mailto:mmaxel@isle.net">mmaxel@isle.net</a>) and
Eric Indiran (<a href="mailto:epi@plpt.com">epi@plpt.com</a>)</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>This started as a 7 week project on &quot;DNA Sequence Alignment&quot;,
after about a week of study, we came up with the following
<a href="https://michaeldipperstein.github.io/dna/project.html">plan</a>.
It didn't take to long to realize that we were too ambitious.  The project
evolved into a survey of nucleotide database search techniques.</p>
